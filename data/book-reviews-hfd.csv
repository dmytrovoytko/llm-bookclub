B0049H9AVU000,B0049H9AVU,Amir Levine,Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find--and Keep-- Love,hfd,2010,5.0,9,"Do you bond quickly and deeply, often to the wrong types of people, hoping 'love can be enough'? Do you find yourself constantly anxious and wondering whether or not your partner cares about you? Do you start a relationship feeling good about it, but quickly start to feel overwhelmed and trapped? Have you convinced yourself you are 'not fit for dating' either because you get avoidant or anxious? READ THIS.  I started reading this book about a week ago, and could not put it down once I got into it. This is a complete game-changer of a book for anybody who has struggled with love, and I think anyone getting into dating at all could benefit from reading it to better understand the role their attachment style is playing in how they date and relate. I learned about childhood attachment styles when I was in my graduate program, but that was before a lot of the research about how attachment impacts the physiological responses we have to partnership as adults came out. This book does a really good job of making that research relatable, illustrating examples of different styles at work in a way that's relatable and familiar.  There were entire sections of this book I felt could have come directly out of my diary. Coming to understand how my anxious attachment has played a serious role in how I date, and realizing that instead of fighting some of my anxious impulses (consequently making them worse), I could instead ask my partner for the kind of reassurances I need in a healthy and communicative way, completely changed how I started my next relationship. Recognizing how my scarcity anxiety style of thinking was influencing me pair-bonding to people with a more avoidant style (consequently leading to a lot of heartache) gave me the tools I needed to start actively screening potential relationships for compatible attachment styles to my own.  I seriously think that when I think about my life as a young woman trying to find love and commitment, reading this book and learning about attachment theory has been a pivotal moment in cultivating healthy romance. I feel much more forgiving of my anxieties, and better able to understand where my partner is at, and how to successfully ask for my needs in a way that gives us both freedom and stability."

First things first, the book does not belittle avoidant styles or pass any judgements on any of the styles. I felt i had to mention that since some people complained about such issue.  Secondly, some of the things I found in the book I had already guessed on my own such as confusing anxiety and preoccupation (activated attachment system) with passion or love. However, the book beautifully expands on that and explains the pulls others have on us and the pushes one needs to make to break the cycle.  In my opinion, it successfully communicates scientific facts in a self help manner, thus attracting both categories of audiences."

The book does a good job covering all the bases, to the point where up to a third of the book maybe not pertain to you what-so-ever... Again the book is methodical in its explanation, and I feel it reads like a text book at times and can be bogged down in certain chapters.  I recommend you take the information that is about you, transfer it to index cards and filter out that third of the book that does not pertain to your situation... just to be able to paint a better picture. I do recommend this book, it is very useful and for my situation helpful."

Through my teenage years and early into my twenties, I would enter into romantic relationships only to be plagued by obsessive thoughts about the relationship. It was not fun.  I read this book a few years ago and it was like reading an owner's manual for my mind. Just reading the science behind why I thought the way I thought was enough to put things into perspective for me. I have had fulfilling long-term relationships ever since."

It has lead me to reevaluate my existing relationships and how I approach new ones including friendships, family, and romantic relationships.  I also liked the fact that the book validates that it is okay to need other people which is definitely a rarity in modern society."

The information contained within, if you can stomach the endless sales pitch, is useful. If you follow his workout plans, nutritional advice, etc, I am sure you will achieve the results you are looking for.  That being said, I am shocked I got through the introduction without closing out of the book and hitting 'Remove From Device'. It is basically a 300-page infomercial. When I fully realized this is how the entire book was going to be, I could not NOT read this book in Don Lapre's voice.  Mike, buddy, pal... we bought the book. You closed the deal. Continuing to bash us over the head with your 'What if I told you''s or headlining sections promising SECRETS is just unnecessary. We are in. You have our money.  I would not buy this book again. If an abridged version without all the bs was to be released, I could maybe recommend that, but until then, I'd look elsewhere."

While there maybe thousands of ways to skin a cat in terms of exercise programs if your looking to build muscle and loose fat Bigger Leaner Stronger has all the information you need.  Michael Matthew's gives a nice brief history about why you can not go by what the major muscle magazines advise and why not to follow the Mr. O pro's. The book is backed by plenty of studies proving many of Michael's points and backing his knowledge of bodybuilding and fitness.  I started following only a few of the principles he outlined in this book 3 weeks ago and I have already lost 4 pounds and my strength has gone up every week by at least 10 pounds an exercise consistently. This week I decided to adopt the entire weight regiment outlined in the book and I can not wait to see what kind of positive changes ensue. Excellent no nonsense information about building the body you want!!!!  Update, I am in my 5th week of doing the weight routines and eating methods and I have lost 11 pounds to date and my strength has sky rocketed. This book cuts through all the confusion of workout programs out there and gives you what works to build a great physique. If your like most people who do not want to hear the hype and just want to get to a sensible workout and nutrition program that works then this book is for you.  Some of the sections that explain exercise and terminology might be a bit basic for people who have experience with exercise but they are great reference sections. Great material and the workout routine is producing great results for me and I am working out in my basement with just free weights. I would probably be doing even better if I went to a gym!"
B006XF5BTG007,B006XF5BTG,Michael Matthews,Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body (The Bigger Leaner Stronger Series Book 1),hfd,2014,1.0,111,"I am surprised this book has as many 5 star reviews as it does. It does not deserve them. It does a poor job at what it sets out to do - provide an easy to follow guide to losing weight and gaining lean muscle.  As many reviewers have noted, the book does some things well, and others poorly. It seems to be roughly organized into 3 parts - Motivation, nutrition and diet, and exercise.  The first section - motivation - is largely devoid of actual information, although could be helpful for someone who needs to be told how easy the book's plan is - repeatedly - and how quickly they will see definite results if the plan is followed exactly. This section has two major flaws: The first is that the plan is not an easy plan at all. It IS a GOOD plan, but to bill a plan that requires EXACT meal planning, careful calorie counting, careful attention to the proportion of each meal that comprises fat, carbs, and protein, and rigorous discipline, as an EASY plan is simply inaccurate for anyone with a demanding career or home-life. It appears the author is looking at the demands his plan makes from the perspective of someone whose job is to be a fitness professional - not someone who has other responsibilities. (Incidentally, there is nothing wrong with a challenging plan - but this one will not work well for someone who cannot devote substantial attention to it.) The second flaw is that Mr. Matthews spends a great deal of time addressing how dietary supplements are unnecessary but spends an equal amount of time pointing people to the (numerous) specific products he uses. A quote from his ""The Bottom Line"" section, ""Stick to protein supplements, a pre-workout drink, creatine, glutamine, a multi-vitamin, and throw in CLA and green tea extract if you are cutting, and you will be supplementing the smart way"". While these two positions are not explicitly contradictory, they grate in a way that hurts Matthews' credibility. Matthews' credibility is also damaged as he comes off as somewhat arrogant, or holier-than-thou in that he spends far too much time being appalled that there are professionals with opinions different than his own, or people that actually drink (GASP) tap water. The author is clearly a man who is obsessive/compulsive about his diet and activity. If you cannot afford to be similarly obsessive/compulsive, this book will be little practical use to you.  The second section of the book relates to diet, and is a decent rough description of the concepts - many of them widely accepted - behind how to eat healthier for weight loss and muscle gain. What is missing here, unfortunately, is any sort of specific plan. Matthews proposes nutrition breakdowns, but does not provide much in the way of helpful information on what foods should comprise the nutrition. He does point out that the reader could buy another book of his if they are interested in this information. That would be forgivable except that the information is CRITICAL to adopting the very plan this book puts forth. The reader is left with the choice of seeking out a more comprehensive book in addition to this one, or doing a substantial amount of independent research just to be able to follow through the dietary plan this book proposes.  The last section of the book has a basic weight-lifting regimen. Only three exercises are actually described in detail, with diagrams used sparingly. Other exercises are referred to only by name and Matthews recommends the reader to an outside web source suggesting they go there to watch videos to see how to do them. Again, this is not necessarily horrible, but does cause a reader to wonder if Matthews might be planning a book on Renaissance art that consists only of a suggestion that the reader visit the Louvre. What, exactly, is the reader paying for here?  Sadly, a great deal of the book is very broad information that directs the reader to more specific sources - sources which the author will conveniently sell them. Given that the reader has presumably already purchased this book - to get the very information they are being directed to - it is hard not to feel there is little value for money here.  As other reviewers have noted, the book is readable, flows well, and is conversational in tone. It is not well organized and would be difficult to use as a reference despite its brevity. Much of the information is easily accessible for free online and that which is not can be characterized as the author's personal experiences and opinions. The information that is here is good - although, again, poorly organized. If you are willing to pay the purchase price for the benefit of having Matthews compile some general information on your behalf, it is worthwhile. You could also save your money and simply spend 3-4 hours reading free material online."
B006XF5BTG008,B006XF5BTG,Michael Matthews,Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body (The Bigger Leaner Stronger Series Book 1),hfd,2014,5.0,100,"I rarely write reviews, but this is going to be a long one, because I think this book deserves it.  I work as a business consultant and university professor, which means I usually do not have time to hit the gym. My past few years have been fueled by pizza, McDonald's and all kinds of junk and/or unhealthy food. On top of that, I spent the last 6 years doing absolutely no physical exercises whatsoever. Then I hit 30, and decided to change this.  I went back to the gym and started spending 2 hours a day there. It was gruesome, boring and ultimately unsustainable, as I usually do not have 2 hours to spend.  So I scoured the internet looking for different ideas on how to train. I read a bunch of studies, a few blogs and books by fitness ""gurus"", and accidentally stumbled upon Mike Matthews' blog, Muscle for Life.  After reading a few of his articles, I decided to try his book, Bigger Leaner Stronger. At first glance, it seemed too good to be true, like he was trying to be the next fitness ""guru"" out there, providing simplistic guidelines to something that's usually presented as a much more complex endeavor. As a scientist, I noticed that his ideas were well researched and were supported by scientific literature... Still, it could not be that ""easy"".  But my 2 hour training routines were so boring that I decided to try Mike's plan. I have been following it almost to the letter. Except for cardio, which I do not have time to do and hate doing, and for the fact that I usually cheat on my diet more than I should, I have been following BLS for the past 3 months.  And I have to confess that it changed my life. I am visibly bigger, leaner and stronger. I have good genetics, meaning I do not put on a lot of fat even when I eat a lot. But since I have been doing nothing and eating junk for 6 years, I was at the 25% body fat range. So I started with a cut (as instructed by Mike) and I am following it until I hit 10% B.F.  Mike's program is simple, but it's not easy. It's simple because, if you follow it properly, you really do not need to spend more than 45-60 minutes in the gym. It's not easy because you have to lift really heavy weights to see results. If you can do 7 reps with that weight, then you need to add more so you hit the 4-6 reps limit. And you have to keep pushing -- ideally, you have to add weight every week. This is not easy and not for everyone. But I love it.  Another thing is dieting. Despite what Mike says (that you do not need to stop eating what you like, and you do not need to starve), well... you do. I have changed the way I eat and, for the most part, eating is now something that I do because I have to, not something I do for pleasure. Come on, I used to eat pizza everyday, there's no way eating tuna with salad and a teaspoon of olive oil is going to be something that I love. But I got used to it, and now I do it almost everyday. Every now and then I cheat, but I am keeping it under control. Also, Mike's advise on supplements is really, as he says, ""no BS"". I love it.  To follow BLS you have to be disciplined and you must trust the author. If you train, eat and rest as Mike advises, you will notice visible changes in 1 month.  Within these 3 months, here is what happened: I have gained muscle (friends say ""wow, you are getting big"", shirts are getting tighter around the shoulder). I have lost 10 pounds (I was at 195 pounds, now I am 185, pants are getting loose around the hips). I am feeling better, more energetic and overall happier.  So I give this book 5 stars because I thank Mike Matthews for his work. I am following his blog and I hope to be able to follow ""Beyond BLS"" soon. Thanks and congratulations, Mike. Keep up the good work."
B006XF5BTG009,B006XF5BTG,Michael Matthews,Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body (The Bigger Leaner Stronger Series Book 1),hfd,2014,3.0,95,"As a top ranked competitive powerlifter and author of my own book, [[ASIN:B007R7FBJ4 Monster Squat: A Step By Step Guide to a Bigger Squat!]], I know a thing or two about training. I saw all the reviews on this book and thought it would be something to have a look at. I have been competing for a while in some of the heavier weight classes and was looking for a way to stay strong but drop my body weight down to get in some of the lighter classes.  After reading this book, I have a mixed review.  First the bad. The first part of the book, like one of the other reviewers stated, was all about how easy it would be to get the body you want as well as how people have been misled by the fitness industry. It was more of an advertisement for the Bigger Leaner Stronger program and a bashing session of the fitness industry. I would suggest to skip to Chapter 10 and start reading from there that's where the usefully information really begins.  Now the good. The program is as basic is it gets making it is easy to follow. Let me sum it up in one sentence. CREATE A STRICT TRAINING AND DIET PLAN AND STICK TO IT! The suggested routines and diet plans are easy to implement and follow even if you never step one foot into a gym in your life. Follow the plan and you will see results.  To end this review, as for me there was not too much in here I did not already know. In fact, when I started out weight training a long time ago, I actually followed a similar program and it worked. For anyone training for a specific sport, like powerlifting, the Bigger Leaner Stronger program may be a good substitute from your normal training regimen when you are in your ""off"" season and the info on nutrition is a very useful. To anyone just starting weight training, this program will be the most effective and for others that train now and are stuck in a rut, this will help get you through it."

Today I am a happy for 57 year old woman. Mike is telling the truth when he tells you you can achieve the body of your dreams. I stuck to the program and ignored the naysayers. I am now 115lbs and only 14% body fat. Over 30 years of yoyo dieting and different exercise programs including running and I finally found what works, that is the program you will learn in 'Thinner Leaner Stronger'"

Helps you document all the TLS exercises and track your progress!!! _________________________________________  You can literally buy this book and trash every single copy of Shape, Oxygen, and Cosmo you have, discontinue the crazy dangerous CrossFit, and kiss Jillian Michaels goodbye.  I have seen it, done it, plus 20 years in the Army, many marathons and two babies later determined that these do not work.  Michael Matthews' book does!  When I hit 40 I could feel my energy starting to dip and I was starting to see ever so slight indications that my body was past its peak despite keeping a fairly steady weight.  I researched and determined that weight training was the way to beat it, and I let myself lift heavier than I thought was appropriate for a woman.  After about 2 months I started to get firmer and was hooked.  I became a regular at the gym, but my routines were all 'winging it,' trying to copy what I saw in magazines, on YouTube, and at the gym.  I was getting the easy newbie gains, but I was not confident that my splits would get me to the next level that I wanted to achieve.  I am now at month 6 and have plateaued.  I have been looking for a routine road map that is logical, based on evidence-based medicine using statistically significant studies (former pharma rep here!), simple, and minimizes my time at the gym.  I am divorced with two kids and a demanding career, so I have my limits.  I have paid a personal trainer, but I noticed that he's not really willing to prescribe a sound routine for me because he wants me to stay with him for a revenue stream.  I did not want to be shelling out $$$ to see gains.  I found TLS after borrowing a friend's copy of The Shredded Chef.  I thought that nutrition would solve all my problems, but after checking out the Muscle For Life site I knew that though nutrition is the main factor, my routine was not focused enough to get me much further.  Since all the magazines and blogs were so confusing and this Kindle edition was only $7 and change, I purchased the Kindle TLS.  I downloaded it onto my phone and can take it to the gym for reference.  The book lays a great foundation of how are bodies are built, how there are physiological variations amongst us, what the science proves about exercise, and how this translates to a sound lifting routine that will produce results.  The road map for the best weight training approach is so clear, so direct that there's no question of what you should do and how you should do it when you walk in the gym.  When I read the TLS formula on page 150 of the Kindle edition it was like reading the Rosetta Stone.  I have been searching for this formula for the last 4 months and I am REALLY excited to apply it.  TLS also prioritizes the exercises which is helpful since some of them were clearly not equal but I was not sure which was most effective. I am tweaking my diet a bit, but I am very sure that I have the key to reduce body fat and get the shoulders and butt I want.  I have got my cellulite reduced quite a bit, but this formula is going to get me all the way there.  Final word of advice:  This book is so concise and complete you will not need any other investment when it comes to programming your own routine.  It could help any woman who has been hitting that elliptical or zumba class without much change.  Not bad for less than $8!  Find a trainer you trust and pay for a session or two to walk through proper techniques for the 5-6 major compound moves that you must master.  Then plug that TLS formula into your phone and get to it!"

Would the endorsements/praise section and the foreward be considered the start or ... pre-start??).  So...the endorsements section at the very beginning...Mike Matthews included 12 endorsement/praise blurbs from other authors, bodybuilders, etc...12 people who are ALL males.  All 12...that struck me as very odd and an unwise choice for a book that's directed at women...it also felt tone deaf in a post-me too world so I initially gave Mike a pass assuming that his book must have been written sometime prior to ~2017 or so.  Nope!  Copyright 2019, sooooo... hmmm.  But, I kept reading... Then I got to the Foreword - also written by a man -(Mark Rippetoe - who also provided the first of 12 endorsement blurbs in the section before) and he starts into how he and Mike became ""buddies"" and ""too many abs"" and ""you know how golfers are"" and ...all of a sudden I felt this nauseating wave of bro-ness wash over me and I had to put the book down. The next day, after forcing myself to keep an open mind and give Mike the benefit of the doubt, I started reading again... It did not get any better.  Within the first couple of pages in Chapter 1 I could not shake the strong condescending, mansplainy vibe this book was giving me.  I am sure that this book carries a wealth of valuable information, instruction and guidance, but I will be reading and learning it all from someone else.  Mike Matthews, you need to do better."

I did a search on Amazon and this book stood out among the rest because it was specifically written for women beginning strength training/body building and few good books exist.  What surprised me the most was when I received an email from the author asking me if I had any questions about the book or training.  At first I thought this can not be a real person but it was.  Michael Matthews is a very generous person who really wants to help you by teaching you the most effective method to get leaner and stronger.  Mike's straight forward no-nonsense nuts and bolts approach to weight training appealed to me.  Through his personal trials and errors with his own journey in body building, Mike tells you what you should do.  He gives you a training menu, supplement advice and a diet guideline.  5 days of less than one hour per day of weight training and 3 hours of cardio per week is all you need.  I am new to this whole world of body building and it's my first week, but the program and eating is so far easy for me to follow.  Eating right and lifting heavy weights seems to be the important key to reach success.  I am enjoying the gym for the first time after I quit going years ago because I got bored and saw no results.  I have a specific goal to transform my body and see the same gym members from 9 years ago doing the same routines with no visible results.  My target is to build upper body strength and muscle, make my legs stronger, get rid of my mini muffin top on my backside and have a power butt.  Do not let your husband, trainers or hulks at the gym intimidate you from trying to use the men's machines at the gym which women often are afraid to use fearing that they will bulk up with big muscles which is nonsense.  It's never too late to try something new at any age.  I am 50 years old and it has been a personal dream of mine to do some sort of body building like this since I was a teenager.  Since I bought this book, I am having fun doing something new and different from what all the other women here in Japan are doing at my gym."

Lofty goal -but his first book BLS got me this far- 18% BF and abs starting to show. The man know his stuff.

Frankl,Man's Search for Meaning,hfd,2006,5.0,405,"When I first started reading Man's Search.... last week I was repulsed by the descriptions of the concentration camp experiences. How could humans be like that? Even though of course we have known about them for 70 years now, it is horrible to read about them. My temptation was to put the book aside, I told someone it was ""depressing."" But how glad I am that I persevered (because it was our Book Club choice this month.) Ultimately, this book is a hopeful paen to humankind's ability to rise above all suffering, to find our own individual meaning to our existence and in that way make sense of why we are in the world and why we should continue in it, doing our very best. This book transcends religion even as I recognize so much of what Frankl writes in my own religious beliefs. Truly a must read for people as soon as they are old enough to understand it--perhaps mid teenage years."
B009U9S6FI016,B009U9S6FI,Viktor E. Frankl,Man's Search for Meaning,hfd,2006,5.0,326,"For some reason, I put off reading this book for many years.  I had read excerpts that made me want to read it, but getting the book and sitting down to read it just seemed to not fit into my plans.  I am so glad I finally read it.  For about twenty years, I read many stories about World War Two.  I wanted to know why no one helped the Jews.  The most gratifying part of the reading was to find that there were many people that endangered their own lives and the lives of their families in order to hide Jews from the Germans.  So, to follow a Jew into the concentration camps and read his observations was enlightening.  Some survived the camps while others died.  They all ate the same food, suffered the same diseases, performed the same work, and suffered the freezing temperatures.  Why did some survive?  That is what Victor Frankl wanted to know and with close observation, he saw the pattern that gave meaning to life and helped some survive while others gave up and died.  His ideas are applicable to modern day problems as well as his methods."
B009U9S6FI017,B009U9S6FI,Viktor E. Frankl,Man's Search for Meaning,hfd,2006,5.0,295,"Whoever said life is not fair was spot-on: it is not.  But that's ok according to Frankl the author here who spent the hardest years of his life in a Nazi concentration camp.  Those that await life to contribute to their happiness or well-being will always be disapointed.  Its not what you expect of life but what life expects of you.  In an existential way Frankl points out that we are only a spec in the universe that has no meaning except for what we give it.  When I was in first grade I remember a poster on the colorful classroom wall that said ""Your attitude determines your altitude.""  For some reason this book made me remember that poster of decades ago.  The idea is that its not what happens to you but how you react to the situation.  In fact in life you mostly cannot control what happens to you--some of it a result of nature and nurture--but you have 100% full control to how you interpret it.  I am not wise enough to know if everything happens for a reason or not but I have learned that in everything there is meaning.  The meaning is what you interpret it to be for you.  Those that do not see meaning in life are often those that think of life as either unfair or as Frankl offers--boring.  Logos (Greek for ""meaning"") is the root of Frankl's new form of therapy, Logotherapy, can be through work that you find meaningful (not your s***ty 9-5 job); finding love in another (not the mere infatuation with your significant other) or a cause that you truly believe in (not those unspecific pie in the sky things like world peace).  The encouragement in this book is to live your life like this is actually your second life, the first of which you screwed-up and now are about to do it again.  You do not have to suffer to get there but keep in mind some of the most remarkable transformations have been those who were told that they only have so long to live (i.e. cancer patients) who went on to make their final months more meaningful than their entire life had been.  Its never too late.  Whether you are confused, feel neglected by life or are just bored this book is for you (as it was for me).  So what's the meaning of your life?  When a student asked Frankl he said that his meaning was to show others how to find meaning in their life.  I trust that this review can inspire you to have a read of Man's Search for Meaning--perhaps one of the most insightful and meaningful books of all time."
B009U9S6FI018,B009U9S6FI,Viktor E. Frankl,Man's Search for Meaning,hfd,2006,5.0,224,"It's not exactly a review but some thoughts after reading this book and observing current events.  Can you imagine life being upended in a matter of weeks? You were forced to board a train to Auschwitz for a new life of unknowns. When you arrived, you were either directed to the left or to the right. You and your family were separated. You were instructed to go right while the rest of your family were instructed to go left. The life for the right group turned out to be half a decade of dehumanizing tortures. As for the left group, they were murdered within 24 hours of arrival to Auschwitz. You learned about the fate of the left group by realizing what all the smokes were rising above the structure your family went into. I was in shock and disbelief when I read about this in Man’s Search for Meaning but this crazy thing DID happen 80 years ago, just a few years before my parents were born. How could this world be so barbaric?  Before Auschwitz, most people were living a fairly normal life worrying about paying their bills, raising their family, advancing their careers, etc just like us ordinary beings today.  People know there’s war but I doubt people thought about how they could be swallowed by the wars in a matter of weeks started by sinister people who only care about their own power. The whole thing is just insane and ridiculous and you would hope humanity learned its lessons. Nonetheless, 80 years later, we are back to square one. The war in Ukraine is ruthless and absurd. It destroyed a country where hardworking people falsely thought they could live in peace and prosperity. The Russian soldiers are asked to invade and to do cruel things Putin asked them to do: murdering, vandalizing, setting things on fire and destructing instructures that took years to build. I don’t think these Russian soldiers out of their own will would want to do this. What exactly is this evil power force making people do crazy and destructive things? Is it really just Putin? Or somehow our world allows this to happen.  This reminds me of the story Haruki Murakami wrote about his father. His father was forced to go to China to fight the war for Japan during WWII. He was a 19 year-old, having grown up in a Buddha temple in Kyoto.  Despite the Buddhist teachings,  he was forced to go to war by the government. His father witnessed the killing of Chinese prisoners of war and might even be forced to do the executions. Part of the military training at the time was for new soldiers to practice killing POW to get them into “the zone”, to become a competent fighter. His father told Murakami about this and this made a huge impression on him.  He could sense his father was deeply affected by this experience for the rest of his life, with grief and guilt. After all, he was complicit. But he as an individual had no choice. If the government forced him to choose war, he could not choose peace instead. If the government goes completely insane, we as citizens have no recourse.  As I am typing this up, I am wondering how long the peaceful life we have in America would last. Three months ago most Ukrainian people probably couldn’t imagine what lay ahead. Should I worry about my family in Taiwan? Things can change drastically in a very short period of time. My husband and his family left Vietnam in 1982 to escape communism. They endured several years of communism rule and my father in law was jailed for a couple of years for “helping Americans”. Prior to the communist takeover, the family ran a large rice mill and owned a substantial amount of prime real estate in Saigon. Then Americans left. Overnight  they lost all their assets to the communist regime. They went from a materially rich life to a life of hunger and partial homelessness. Young women had to hide to avoid being raped.  My mother in law sold her gold jewelry in the black market to get her husband out of jail and the family escaped to America penniless. Who is responsible for all the sufferings? They did nothing wrong. They were hardworking people running an honest business. Perhaps they didn’t pay enough attention to international politics. But the price they had to pay was absurdly high.  We individuals are so small and powerless we don’t know what current of our crazy time can swallow us despite our innocence and futile efforts. The thought that we are in control is an illusion. When I think about the great suffering in Auschwitz, China, Vietnam and endless other man-made tragedies,  I am so grateful for the peaceful time I still live in and whatever worries I have seem so trivial.  If we strive for anything for the world, we should strive for peace."
B009U9S6FI019,B009U9S6FI,Viktor E. Frankl,Man's Search for Meaning,hfd,2006,1.0,85,"A MUST READ if you want to be bored.  Please do not get me wrong. The bigoted cruelty that humans have cassualy inflicted upon other humans is unimaginable. Unfortunately such bigoted thoughts and wishes continue today.  But! I found the message to be repetitively repetitive. A self help book that repetitively says help thyself repetitively like so many other self help books.  When sad be happy. When weak be strong. When pessimistic be optimistic.  Basically, whatever your circumstances, if you are lost you should go and find yourself.  I did not find any magic here. I guess that I was not meant to be a magician."

This book has helped me understand why I have made the same relationship mistakes over and over, even after believing I had gotten to the root of it all. It's one thing to intellectually understand how you have been ""damaged"" and another thing entirely to correct the pathways of ingrained thinking and biological response to situations. Most refreshing was the idea presented that the ""damage"" was actually survival mechanisms used to protect the you underneath. The you that is still sound and undamaged underneath the layers. Layers you can peel away and bring forth who and what you really are. Fantastic book even non-professionals can understand."

Followed his recommendations and finally started losing real weight for the first time in years. First 2 weeks easily lost 12lbs. I am sold! It NOW finally all makes sense. Like a puzzle piece that was missing all this time. I am telling everyone I can about this book now and buying copies for my friends."

Though I am not obese but I was overweighted and my fasting blood glucose stayed borderline. This condition has not improved until 2 years ago I started practicing 5:2 fasting advocated by Dr Michael Mosley. What I have to say is it works like miracles! The effectiveness of intermittent fasting makes me so fascinating about the underlying pathophysiology of fasting, type II diabetes and insulin  resistance metabolic syndrome. Thanks Dr Fung who wrote this book that have provided me the clear presentation of the relevant scientific evidence. It's very enjoyable to read this book and Dr Fung has presented all these scientific evidences in such a fun, easy-to-understand way."

It changed the way I look at weight loss!  My entire adult life I have known that counting calories and killing myself at the gym was not doing the trick - I never lose the weight, and yet, my doctors and dietitians and countless books kept telling me to keeping going and eventually I would see results, or I was doing it wrong, or I was eating more calories than I thought, or I did not workout hard enough, etc., etc., etc.  I always see my friends eat more than me and they are thin. I have even gone so far as to ask them to keep a journal of what they eat so I can get an idea of how many calories to eat. Turns out they eat more than I do!  This book explains why."
B07D23CFGR026,B07D23CFGR,James Clear,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,hfd,2018,1.0,672,"I was quite disappointed in this book given the reviews.  It could be summed up in a couple of pages.  There is no plan for making improvements in your life, just a few obvious observations about habits that are repeated over and over.  Not worth the time or money."
B07D23CFGR027,B07D23CFGR,James Clear,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,hfd,2018,2.0,490,"I have been receiving James Clear's newsletter for several months so when the book got out I ordered the kindle version immediately. But while the newsletter is occasionally interesting, the book is rather empty. There's nothing new, it's just a rehash of other books on the subject. There is no new perspective, no new insights. And there's nothing atomic about it. I am really disappointed, and I could not believe that the book became an instant best seller. If you have never read anything about habit forming, you will benefit from this book. But if you have, I do not see what you can get from Atomic Habits. I am also becoming tired of all the personal success stories from book authors because they can not be applied to the layman. I found there was nothing to learn from James' baseball days, as I never was an athlete and never excelled in sport. Feels like the average reader can not do this. I have bought the audible and Kindle version and will return one of them, keeping the other just to be fair to the author"
B07D23CFGR028,B07D23CFGR,James Clear,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,hfd,2018,1.0,126,"I barely made it through 1/3 of the book. Reading it as an audiobook, I found it very repetitive and monotonous. As I read, and as the author spoke of methods and mental operations, my mind was drawn to two books that I read decades ago: [[ASIN:0143111884 Psycho-Cybernetics]] and [[ASIN:0061122432 Addiction and Grace]], both written by medical doctors, both which explain things like habits and their formation in a way that has stayed with me all these years. In contrast, I remember little of what I read in this book, maybe because it was so annoying and kept making me think of what I learned long ago."
B07D23CFGR029,B07D23CFGR,James Clear,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,hfd,2018,1.0,33,"Atomic Habits is a beautiful, fancy, and well marketed book. But it's the wrong book if you are serious about self-improvement. It's surface level over a single method of habit formation and is just flat wrong about some of the principles he claims are key to habit formation. For example, using your identity as the base to build your habits on is dangerous. To understand why, I'd suggest the ""Awareness"" book below. Therefore, if you really want to change read these books instead:  - The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal  - Awareness by Anthony de Mell"

It was one of the least informative nonfiction books I have read in years. I was skeptical of all the rave reviews and held off buying it for almost a year. I should have remained skeptical and saved my money. I could not really think of one thing I gained after closing it at the end. The biggest part of it, the habit loop, was explained so poorly that I did not really grasp it yet alone try to incorporate it into my life. The Power of Habit is incredible. If you have not read that yet, spend your money on that one and really get an education on what a habit is, how to create good ones and eradicate bad ones."

Main takeaway is you are normal. It does not deal with asexuality at all and I read a Reddit post from some ace people who had read and other than some parts of the book where it seems she may have forgotten (or ignored) ace people are a thing, they enjoyed it and loved learning about this. There was nothing outright harmful that I could recall so if this interests you, or you have a partner who isn’t ace, then this could be informative (it is geared to people born with a vulva but plenty in there can be applied to others as well). The author also shows up in The Principles of Pleasure on Netflix with a lot of the same concepts and things brought up in the book."

B09JPHQZQZ034,B09JPHQZQZ,KC Davis,How to Keep House While Drowning: A Gentle Approach to Cleaning and Organizing,hfd,2022,5.0,19,"but it took the same experience as the author (post partum depression during COVID lockdowns with an infant and no competent spousal assistance) to get me halfway there.  There is so much of value here, in such an easily digestible format, that I find myself recommending it all the damn time.  Finding words (and validation) for the conclusions I’d been coming to but felt too lazy and guilty to own has been far more life-changing than you’d think.  There’s a huge difference between shame-facedly paring down your daily tasks until you can bare to face them but stop mopping the floor every day in the process, and accepting that skipping the mopping stage is actually fine and you do not need to feel the shame associated with no longer aiming for perfection when you can’t remember the last time you combed your hair.  Functional is fine.  Perfection in all things is unnecessary and not compatible with the average person’s life."
