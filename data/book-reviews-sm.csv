B005H0O8KQ000,B005H0O8KQ,John McPhee,Annals of the Former World,sm,2000,5.0,76,"Page-turning suspense, profound human interest, a remarkable narrative arc, and shocking violence. Subject: geology. I am not kidding.  I am a complete newbie to geology. But even if, like me, you do not know schist about the subject, you will enjoy this wonderful book. Other reviewers here have pointed out some outdated information or subjective emphases. Okay, but he's writing a narrative, not a textbook.  Before charging off on this book -- which, BTW, is great value for money -- be sure you are familiar with Kindle's look-up feature. I used it literally dozens of times to get definitions of unfamiliar terms. What you get out of this book depends on the effort you put into it."
B005H0O8KQ001,B005H0O8KQ,John McPhee,Annals of the Former World,sm,2000,5.0,26,"Take a field trip through North America's Basin and Range province, stretching East to West from Utah to California and South to North from Mexico to Oregon, and you are in a land being pulled apart by Tectonic Forces to someday becoming an arm jutting out from North America into the Pacific Ocean.  Baja and California will become first a very long peninsula then later a archipelago west of the continent.  Our world is indeed changing all around us.  If you really love reading about Geology and Geography then John McPhee's Pulitzer Prize winning 1998 book ""Annals of the Former World"" may be just what you are looking for.  It's  actually like reading 5 shorter books on different aspects of geology: regional landscapes, exotic features, exploring the craton and even California*.  But no matter what your interest are, if you tackle this monumental work of over 700 pages be prepared for lots of technical terminology in the Earth Sciences and Geography along with some interesting bits of cultural-history, biographies of various geologist and what frontier life was like in the various regions covered.  Some readers may not like McPhee's frequent philosophical or biographical passages, that can be quite long and cover a lot of ground, but his inner thoughts just reflect his passion for geology and all the related sciences'.  For me this was a long, tough but rewarding read.  Some portions of the book flowed along smoothly while others left me feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the author's lengthy and technical writing style, so unless you are up for a very challenging read you might want to look elsewhere.  But I, for one, found this to be an enjoyable book that took me to remote location around North America, the Globe, and back into Earth's Deep Time exploring the origins of our landscape, where it came from and where it's going.  McPhee's writing  is very descriptive, giving you a clear picture of the places he, and his geologist friends, were traveling through. There are not many illustrations in the Kindle edition; a few photos, some charts and maps, so my iPad got a real workout as I looked up various mountain ranges and other geological regions.  But it became clear to me that if I were to take a motor trip through the western United States I would want to have a friendly geologist with me just to help me understand what we were looking at.  All features on the Earth have a long history and it helps to have some idea of their origins and the events that led to their present condition.  In this book you will learn about sea mounts and hot-spots, plate tectonics and continental drift, how mountains grow and erode away, how seas come and go and how long all this has been going on.  Be sure to read the author’s Afterword: “A Narrative Table of Contents”, it will explain a lot of questions you may have.  In my case I read it after but it would also make a good introduction to the author and book.  The science in this book was cutting-edge in 1998 but things are always changing and new theories can spring up almost overnight.  Over the past decade new observations have lead to new ideas and new ways of looking at the land and its history.  But things in geology change at a very slow pace, so whatever “dated” material there may be in the text shouldn’t make any difference to the general reader.  If you are interested in learning the history of land formations, diamonds, glacial till or just plain old rocks, than ""Annals of the Former World"" is a good bet!  I had no technical or downloading problems with this Kindle edition.  *As far as I can tell the text was also published as 4 or 5 different books, one for each chapter.  Last Ranger"
B005H0O8KQ002,B005H0O8KQ,John McPhee,Annals of the Former World,sm,2000,4.0,21,"As someone with a technical background but virtually no geology, this well written book is just a bit too much for me.  I love the way McPhee writes and his descriptions are masterful. Still, the quantity of geologic periods and the terms that accompany them left me weary.  Maybe I am a visual learner and would need to take a geology class in the field where I could see just what he is talking about."
B005H0O8KQ003,B005H0O8KQ,John McPhee,Annals of the Former World,sm,2000,5.0,13,"This is a collection of 5 previous books by this iconic Geologist/writer. Highly technical but for the reader who will stick with him, the best way to gain insights into global geologic history. A good refresher and teacher for geologists whose educations or experiences are dated. Keep a dictionary handy, but stick with it to become re-educated or refreshed in how the world got this way."

B018E7HFNK005,B018E7HFNK,Christie Wilcox,Venomous: How Earth's Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry,sm,2016,1.0,24,"This book gets a one star review which is unrelated to the content or style.  The book is actually well written and extremely interesting.  However, whoever created the Kindle version should be fired--or at least promoted to position where he or she can do less harm.  None of the book's illustrations are included in the Kindle edition.  This might not be fatal--but still annoying--but the blank pages where the illustrations should appear apparently contain some text so that several sentences and maybe even whole paragraphs are missing.  This makes reading a little difficult.  I liked the book well enough that I will probably go over to my local Barnes and Noble and pick up a hardcover version but I am extremely disappointed in the way it was prepared for my Kindle."
B018E7HFNK006,B018E7HFNK,Christie Wilcox,Venomous: How Earth's Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry,sm,2016,5.0,9,"This is an excellent book by a great science communicator - and one that I found hard to put down. It's a well-balanced narrative that combines personal anecdotes, biographical interludes focused on some true characters, and a strong core of solid science. Venomous creatures - and their number is huge - both enthrall & terrify us, and that fear leads to attempts to destroy them. Wilcox argues convincingly that we should instead respect and protect these creatures - if not for their own intrinsic & ecological value, then because they have the very real potential to save our lives.  very strongly recommended."
B018E7HFNK007,B018E7HFNK,Christie Wilcox,Venomous: How Earth's Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry,sm,2016,5.0,7,"This book is scientifically stimulating but, perhaps more importantly, it is vibrant and hopeful for humans and venomous creatures as well. The biochemistry is artfully engaging and easy to follow.  The author uses a deft hand blending breakthroughs and personal experiences to create an accessible and engaging story.  It was literally better than many novels I have read in terms of entertainment."
B018E7HFNK008,B018E7HFNK,Christie Wilcox,Venomous: How Earth's Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry,sm,2016,5.0,6,"I am not any type of scientist, naturalist, doctor or any other type of person who you'd expect to read this type of book, but this book was very thought provoking, entertaining, and we will written. The most insightful explanation of the mechanics of evolution I have ever read. Meet lots of interesting, diverse organisms. I never had a clue or much of any thoughts about the huge range of toxins and their used for many species including us. Another deep and good argument toward stopping destroying life's diversity on this planet."

B0727TN8H6010,B0727TN8H6,Steve Brusatte,The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,sm,2018,5.0,147,"I browsed the reviews before I bought the book and was very amused by the one-star reviewers who groused about Dr. Brusatte's writing style. Apparently they think dinosaur books should be fusty tomes written in the finest Dense Academic by human dinosaurs and they were irked not to find that stuff in this book.  Well, no. And that's the best thing about The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs.  Dr. Brusatte clearly loves what he's doing. And he has fun doing it. And he wants to share the joy with the world. He has a bright, engaging style and he can tell a story like nobody's business. Just wait till you get to the tale of the breakup of Pangaea, or the day the asteroid hit. You will not find a better, more vivid account anywhere.  I originally checked the book out of the library but it was soon clear I'd have to buy my own copy. If you care anything at all about dinosaurs, get this book. Encourage Steve Brusatte to write more!"
B0727TN8H6011,B0727TN8H6,Steve Brusatte,The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,sm,2018,3.0,100,"I am a geologist, although not a paleontologist, so my perspective is admittedly biased. I can say with humble confidence that I know more than the average person about fossils, dinosaurs, geological processes, Earth history, etc., but certainly less than the author, particularly regarding dinosaur ecology and paleontology. This said, the book has good points and some less than good, and 3.5 stars seems about right for me.  If you are interested in learning a bit about dinosaurs and their evolution, then this is a decent book that includes some relatively recent discoveries or consensus. I enjoyed it, and I learned a few things that I admittedly did not know. However, I came away with the same impression as some other reviewers; the author has a robust ego, especially for somebody who is younger than the length of just my professional career as a geologist. One would think that the author has been rubbing elbows with every important vertebrate paleontologist since Darwin himself discovered fossils in South America while taking land excursions from the Beagle. Somehow, I just don’t think a paleontolgist barely 10 years into his career has seen and done so many marvelous and revolutionary things, but perhaps I am just a jaded old fart. In any case, less thumbnail shout-outs to his early-career compadres and a bit more meat on those (dinosaur) bones would have made this a better read."
B0727TN8H6012,B0727TN8H6,Steve Brusatte,The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,sm,2018,1.0,46,"Very disappointing. Though the author is an expert, the biology in the book is at an eighth-grade level.. There is a galling amount of padding, such as biographies of paleontologists the author knows, and descriptions of  towns, of landscapes, or the difficulty in catching the right train. in China.  I have the audible verrsion and kept puttin the speed of reading to two-and-a-half to get through these passages, thinking, 'Please, please tell me something about dinosaurs that a moderately scientifically informed reader would not already know. There was some, but not much, of this. Good book for a smart kid in early high school."
B0727TN8H6013,B0727TN8H6,Steve Brusatte,The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,sm,2018,2.0,37,"This book is simultaneously a short-read (main text 350pgs) and a slog to read. As others have noted (see the 1 star reviews), the author's writing style distracts from the main narrative of the text (dinosaur evolution). Much of this text reads like a work of fiction written by high school student. To wit, 'The Permian Period-when that weird and wonderful cast of creatures was frolicking alongside the Polish lakes.' Frolicking? Really?  Almost every time a new person is mentioned, the author will divaricate from the main topic and then expose the reader to perfervid prose and excessive adjectives. For example, 'The man holding it was young, with a close-cropped military hairstyle, his hairline just starting to recede like mine. His eyes were dark, and he was squinting. A thin veneer of stubble covered his face, and he seemed to be a little darker than most of the Poles I knew. Tanned, almost.' Who cares!? This person is nobody to me. But this goes on for pages. Plus he goes into the educational backgrounds, childhood experiences, etc of these people. I approached the beginning of each chapter and chapter subsection with dread, knowing the page after page was marinated with superfluous details.  As for the main topic: dinosaurs and their evolution, this book is sorely lacking. I wish he wrote about dinosaurs at the level of detail that he writes about his colleagues. He really does not write about evolution in a way that informs the reader how the process works or why certain adaptations were, well adaptive. These are examples of the poor level of detail that he goes into,  nothe second, the avemetatarsalians, developed into pterosaurs,' '...looking at traces left behind by the type of animal that evolved into dinosaurs,' '...at some point, one of these primitive dinosauromorphs evolved into true dinosaurs.'  That's it. Then he moves on. Here's his discussion of bird evolution 'They lost their tails and teeth, ditched one of their ovaries, and hollowed out their bones even more to lessen their weight. Their breathing became more efficient, their growth faster, and their metabolism more supercharged, so that they became fully warm-blooded, able to maintain a constant high internal body temperature. With each evolutionary enhancement, they became even better fliers, some able to stay airborne for hours on end, others able to sail through the oxygen-starved upper reaches of the troposphere, over the rising Himalayas.' While before he went into some detail in feather evolution (his facts are bit sketchy though) the rest of these features are just mentioned in passing. As to why any of these traits adaptive, it's on you to do your own research.  'Walking upright, it seems, was one of the way in which animals recovered-and indeed, improved-after the planet was shocked by the volcanic eruptions.' And that's it. He does not say why that's the case, it just is. Other times he will say 'we do not know why...' Not knowing for certain and not having a theory are two different things. This is a really frustrating book to read. As someone whose childhood love of dinosaurs has been retained into adulthood, and now I am sharing that passion with my children, I eagerly bought this book hoping for the most updated information on the evolution of dinosaurs. What I get instead was detailed biographies of paleontologists, a cursory overview of dinosaurs through the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, and a feeling of disappoint that will gave me the fantods.  The only chapter that I really enjoyed was the T. Rex chapter. I have always wondered, why is T. Rex so special? To my thinking, there were other predators that were larger than T. Rex, so it was not size. There were other predators that were more agile, so it was not speed. There were other predators that dominated the food chain longer, so it was not staying power. My conclusion was, since T. Rex was one of the first super predators discovered and was a cultural phenomenon in the early 20th century, that was why it had staying power. However, this chapter in the book does answer the question, Why T. Rex? That chapter also shows, however, that T. Rex is probably the best studied of all the dinosaurs, so if that amount of time and effort went into another predator, maybe T. Rex would lose some of its luster. Anyway, If only you could purchase that chapter alone, it's worth the read.  Overall, I do not recommend this book.  To get an understanding of how great this book could have been, I recommend Neil Shubin's 'Your Inner Fish.' It's not about dinosaurs, but rather the evolutionary links that connect us to other animals. Neil knows how to write to a lay audience in a way that is informative and interesting."
B0727TN8H6014,B0727TN8H6,Steve Brusatte,The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,sm,2018,5.0,23,"This is a review from a reader who has purchased the hardcover, Kindle, and Audible editions of the book: the former for my bookshelf, the second for convenient reading, and the third just to complete the set since I had an Audible credit to burn at the time. Initially I bought Dr. Brusatte's book on a whim: it had occurred to me that paleontology had advanced by leaps and bounds since the nineties when I was actively learning about these prehistoric creatures. I thought, 'Gee, it would be interesting to see how far it's all come since I was checking out books at the school library and playing '3D Dinosaur Adventure' on that crusty old PC.' It certainly does a good job of catching one up on modern views of dinosaurs among paleontologists.  First off, if you are the type of person who expects books on scientific subjects to be a drag to read, have no fear in this case. Steve Brusatte is clearly writing with a mentality very close to what an effective teacher needs to keep students engaged, which is to say: be entertaining, present the information in a lively way, give the audience's enthusiasm room to effectively drive their learning forward. This is not a dry fact-dump, but a 'story,' for want of a better description. It tells the history of the dinosaurs with vigor, often stepping into side-stories about the paleontologists who work to uncover and deduce the details of that story. Thus you learn not only about the dinosaurs, but about the many and varied intrepid men and women who work to find out all they can about them and other aspects of natural history.  The book begins with a colorful description of what the world must have been like in the Permian period, transitioning into the Triassic, where dinosaurs were (contrary to previous belief) bit players, and this is a strong way to open, because it ties in with those side-stories about paleontology, and here we begin to see some discussion on the changing views about dinosaurs and how paleontologists can indeed be mistaken about their findings. It continues on from there. Readers of this book who are willing to and interested in learning about these topics will find this to be an excellent place to begin learning about dinosaurs and paleontology, and those already in the know will likely enjoy it as a refresher course.  The hardcover edition is well-formatted, with a fitting selection of visually-pleasing yet easy-to-read text fonts and a fairly generous use of illustrations, photographs, and occasional diagrams where needed. The Kindle version is a little dodgier by the nature of what it is. The first paragraph or so of any given chapter sub-section has an oddly larger text font than the following paragraphs, but the only difficulty arises from those illustrations and such, which tend to be shrunk-down to fit whatever your display screen is... as is the case with most e-books, these elements do not make the smoothest transition, but this is a perfectly serviceable way to enjoy the book if you are reading it, say, on public transit, or on break at work.  The audiobook's reading works quite well, though I note that at the time of this review Audible narration does not work for the Prologue chapter, even though it is indeed in the audiobook. I assume there was an oversight in programming, and have reported this to customer service. It may even have been fixed by the time you read this review. Other than that and the obvious lack of photographs and images in the audiobook, the manner in which this reading is presented may strike listeners as a tiny bit too geared toward younger audiences, with some exaggeration in voice tone when the reader wants things to sound exciting or intriguing that was quite a long way from how my mental voice vocalized the text while reading it independent of audio accompaniment. That said, it's a pleasant listen. I just hope they fix that Audible narration problem with the prologue.  All in all, I highly recommend this book for those interested in the subject, especially in hardcover, as it's a very nice addition to anyone's bookshelf. Readers be forewarned, however. Paleontology is an advancing science at all times, and the information in this book is likely to go out of date in a surprisingly short span of time, as the educational material from the nineties and 2000's did. If you find it interesting enough to pursue, however, you might consider staying up-to-date on paleontological finds and theories on your own time by following the works of both Dr. Brusatte and others in his field. It certainly can not hurt to know more about the planet you were born on, yes?"
B07R8P96KW015,B07R8P96KW,Carl Safina,"Becoming Wild: How Animal Cultures Raise Families, Create Beauty, and Achieve Peace",sm,2020,5.0,11,Safina explains that many animals pass on life skills and this constitutes culture. Most animals could not survive and certainly could not thrive using only the behaviors that are driven by instinct. Many of his insights are applicable to humans too.  This is an important book.  Very highly recommended.

Some other species have cultures of their own. The author takes to the field and seas with researchers to learn about sperms whales, macaws, and chimpanzees. He also delves into the cultures of bonobos and killer whales, among other animals. Very edifying and easy to read. I like his writing style. You will learn a lot about the clans and families of sperm whales and about chimp social structures and macaw interactions. After reading this edifying work, you will ponder the cultures of other animal groups not mentioned in the book."

You will be awestruck by the sperm whales' almost mystical abilities and the lovely, connected, compassionate lives they live. You will be surprised, amused and enlightened by the complex and successful nature of macaw culture and society. And you will perhaps be frustrated and irked by the often pettily competitive and highly political lives lived by chimpanzees. In his signature style, Safina brings you along into the field with devoted behavioral researchers. You will feel like you are there, and you will be better for the journey. Highly recommended!"

I was rather disappointed due to the fact the author added (in my opinion) too many personal stories about the researchers and himself. Also, I felt there was a lot of conjecture instead of facts.  I felt the author reiterated a lot of the actual facts in such a way that the book could have been shorter than it was if he had not repeated so much. Also, the book read much more like an appeal to humans that animals are more like us than we think/ to save the animals than just facts about the animals.

After some research, I learned that JK Rowling was not writing them, but I still expected them to be in the wizarding world and pre-ordered all of four.  These have nothing to do with Harry Potter. They quote the books and then talk about actual history in a vaguely tangential way. I skimmed through the first half hoping that there would be a story at some point,and remained disappointed.

There are almost no data in the book, except as relates to the experiments the author performs on himself.  There are some interesting factoids sprinkled about, but I would cross reference every one of them before repeating them, as there are also some glaring scientific errors or at least misleading oversimplifications.  The author flies all over the world, paying for treatments, meeting with breathing mentors, meeting with other people who fly all over the world to explore or propound breathing techniques, and chronicles this jet-setting self-absorption in this quick read."

Evidently breathing through your nose the right way (which he never really feels satisfied HE understands) will fix your sciatica, financial problems, and even make a Fiat run better. Evidently anecdotal research from the 1700's is much better than modern applications of the scientific method to large scale health studies. The author's experience ""testing"" a week breathing through his mouth then his nose reads like a an attempt for an Ig Nobel Prize. It's frankly astounding that the author's claimed pedigree has not provided an iota of scientific skepticism and common sense.  Or maybe he's just low on oxygen..."
B087WXGTWF032,B087WXGTWF,Marcus Chown,Infinity in the Palm of Your Hand: Fifty Wonders That Reveal an Extraordinary Universe,sm,2019,4.0,28,I enjoyed the book from the very first page because the author has such a clever writing style. I especially liked the material being presented in short burst of 4 or 5 pages. It takes a great deal of skill and plain hard work for one who has such a vast knowledge of the scientific world  make this ideas simple for us.  This work could easily have earned five stars from me except the author could not control his hatred for former president Trump. On at least two occasions he made demeaning remarks about President Trump that had absolutely nothing at all to do with science. I really do not think introducing hatred in a book of science does any positive except make the author feel good. It detracts from some excellent writing.

It can be overwhelming at times trying to figure it out so this seemed to be a great way to start to learn. With this book the author Carl J Pratt help me understand what quantum physics is, the history and experiments and achievements in quantum mechanics. He discussed wave particle duality dilemma, how particles can be multiple places at once, quantum entanglement, quantum Fields theory, quantum gravity and introduction to string theory. I enjoyed that he helped me peel the way layers of mystery to reveal what's behind most modern technological innovations without getting overwhelmed with complex math. He even showed me real world applications like quantum computing, quantum key distribution and ultra precise clocks. This is a great beginner's guide to start understanding quantum physics. The author help me see that quantum physics can be easy accessible and interesting."

B09FK3FB79038,B09FK3FB79,Steve Brusatte,"The Rise and Reign of the Mammals: A New History, from the Shadow of the Dinosaurs to Us",sm,2022,4.0,16,"This text integrates a very large subject, the entirety of mammalian evolution, in a single volume, using up to date research and sources. In composing a grand narrative it does an excellent job, but the scope of the topic clearly escapes the grasp of this book to handle on anything but a fairly superficial level. In particular, this book is almost entirely text, with only occasional pictures of fossil skeletons or artistic renditions of extinct animals. Critically there are no cladograms to outline relationships between the various groups and there are hardly any diagrams of the critical developments in dentition that characterize the mechanistic understanding of mammal evolution. The result is that many of the organisms and groups mentioned are no more than names.  Overall this book tells a very intriguing story regarding the evolution of mammals, but fails to teach the reader beyond a rather basic outline."
B09FK3FB79039,B09FK3FB79,Steve Brusatte,"The Rise and Reign of the Mammals: A New History, from the Shadow of the Dinosaurs to Us",sm,2022,5.0,14,"Thank you to NetGalley and Mariner Books for this ARC.  Wow! Steve Brusatte's ""The Rise and Reign of the Mammals"" is a wonderfully worthy sequel to his ""Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"". My knowledge of the evolution of mammals has always been pretty sparse; I'd always imagined early mammals as boring little rat-critters running around trying not to be stomped by giant reptiles. (Okay, I did know that they were not actually rodents, but that's all I could picture.) This book showed me how incredibly wrong I was.  This book covers the mammalian journey from the evolution of the earliest stem mammals to the Ice Age megafauna, ending with our own hominid development. Other than the fascinating stories about the discovery of the fossils Brusatte describes, I particularly enjoyed the Ernest Thompson Seton-esque tidbits about the hypothetical lives of these animals.  I'd prefer not to give too much more away, so paleontology fans: check it out yourselves!  Easily 5 stars. Wonderfully done!"
B09FK3FB79040,B09FK3FB79,Steve Brusatte,"The Rise and Reign of the Mammals: A New History, from the Shadow of the Dinosaurs to Us",sm,2022,4.0,5,I am a professional biologist myself.  Most of the content of this book focuses on new discoveries since I finished school 40 years ago.  Not only paleontology but also paleoclimatology have advanced greatly since then.  I can not wait to see how much we learn in the next 40 years!
B09JBJS1MF041,B09JBJS1MF,Ed Yong,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,sm,2022,5.0,79,"There is so much interesting material about animal senses that Yong need not spend much time on his travels and on the scientists involved.  He writes well, emphasizing the basis for the evolution of each sense, physiological, and especially functional.  He always points out the unsolved questions.  For example, the leading theory of how the earth’s magnetic field is sensed involves a quantum interaction between pairs of molecules, a reaction which requires some light and is impacted by the magnetic field.  The candidate molecule pair, in at least some animal’s eyes, has been identified, but not the actual sensory organ.  Besides evolution, another emphasis is all the sensory input around us that we humans are not equipped to recognize, although there are electronic tools to remedy much of that.  I advise the new reader to pay attention to the notes which follow each chapter – many of them are very interesting.   Each sense has its advantages and disadvantages.  For example, smell works around corners and in the dark, and remains after the cause has moved, but it is slow to reach the sensory organ.  Vision can have high resolution, or high sensitivity (requiring little light), but there is a tradeoff between the two.  Most animals that can see color can see UV; it is not known why humans cannot, just conjectures.  I have previously read that human color vision is in part tuned to aid in distinguishing subtle differences in human facial expression.  Incidentally, there are some women with four color cones, not three, which aids them in distinguishing subtle differences in green; this capacity can be tested for, but the subject otherwise does not realize they have a special talent.  A sentence I liked: “The human visual world is in front and humans move into it……  But the avian world is around and birds move through it (i.e. they can see more than 180 degrees, even 360 degrees around their head).”   While reactions to taste are mostly innate, reactions to smell are learned. Elephants can apparently smell better than dogs.  We all know about primary colors, but what this means is that there is no specific light frequency for the color purple, it is developed by our ability to add and subtract the primary color frequencies.  While we have many neurons which register different odors, our subjective consciousness of many odors is also based on combining the reactions of multiple “primary” neurons.   The amount of brain power required to utilize senses, such as echolocation in a bat or dolphin, is very high.  One conjecture about Neanderthals which I have read elsewhere is that more of their brainpower was devoted to vision."
B09JBJS1MF042,B09JBJS1MF,Ed Yong,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,sm,2022,5.0,43,"This book opened my eyes to the different ways that we animals living on this planet perceive the world.  It turns out that there are many more senses other than the five that we were taught about in school.  Some of the ones the author discussed I knew about, but many I had never heard of.  I knew about sonar and echolocation, for example, but animals that can sense magnetic fields?  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the natural world.  My thanks to Random House and NetGalley for an advance reader copy of this book.  It was my pleasure to read and review it."
B09JBJS1MF043,B09JBJS1MF,Ed Yong,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,sm,2022,5.0,40,"I heartily recommend this book to anyone with even a hint of curiosity about science and nature. I was impressed not only at the amount of research that has been conducted on animal senses but at the author’s command of the results of that research. For all of the science reviewed, the book is written in a style which makes for easy reading. I am left awestruck at the diversity and ingenuity of animal senses, as well as how much of that sensing is beyond direct human experience. While we are in some ways a uniquely intelligent species (but sadly without commensurate wisdom), our senses capture a tiny amount of the information present in the environment, and we use only a tiny fraction of the communication techniques used by the animal kingdom."
B09JBJS1MF044,B09JBJS1MF,Ed Yong,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,sm,2022,1.0,30,This is a wonderful book and I find it insightfull and most interesting to read. Unfortunately I bought the Kindle version. The print changes scale very often from normal to too tiny to read. It is true that I have some vision loss but I have not encountered this issue with any other books I have purchased as a Kindle book. When I try to adapt the script it is of no or little help. I will buy this book in hardcover as I realy am enjoying it. Whom ever does the editing or transferring it to Kindle has done a very poor job. So buy the book but not this version. I will rethink future Kindle purchases. The book is 5 stars and this version is barely 1.
B09JBJS1MF045,B09JBJS1MF,Ed Yong,An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us,sm,2022,5.0,16,"This is great read for those of a curious mind. It explores the sensory capabilities of other living creatures with the objective of better understanding their lived experience. Their sensory inputs can be wider or narrower than ours within the realm of the 5 commonly understood senses. Beyond that, we get introduced to other senses that are of major importance to some other species. It's eye opening.  The author brings forward the concept of Umwelt, which I might simply define as the nature of the world as experienced by a particular animal. Humans create a rich and consistent Umwelt based on our brains ability to synthesize the input from our many sensory capabilities. Reasonably, we can assume that all animals do the same, based on their sensory inputs. And given the striking differences in sensory capabilities one can imagine the variety of umwelts that exist. But of course, due to our limitations, we are unable to grasp the character of other Umwelts.  However, the Umwelt concept stays in the background throughout, it never interferes with the rich and detailed information being shared by the author. Even the footnotes make for good reading. In addition to what I have just learned I am keeping this available as a reference."
B09NXV9W12046,B09NXV9W12,Sean M. Carroll,"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Space, Time, and Motion",sm,2022,4.0,92,"Sean Carroll is the author of several books about physics. Although he is justly famous for his popular physics books, he is also the author of one of the best General Relativity textbooks, Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity. There are equations on almost every page of Spacetime and Geometry, but very few in his previous popular physics books. I say ""previous"" because, with The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, that changes. Carroll argues, incontrovertibly, that without the math you do not really understand the physics. He proposes to fix that,  ""The Biggest Ideas in the Universe is dedicated to the idea that it is possible to learn about modern physics for real, equations and all, even if you are more amateur than professional and have every intention of staying that way. It is meant for people who have no more mathematical experience than high school algebra, but are willing to look at an equation and think about what it means. If you’re willing to do that bit of thinking, a new world opens up.""  The Biggest Ideas series (this one is intended as the first book of a trilogy, which he likens to The Lord of the Rings -- no hubris here!) will present the Biggest Ideas in the Universe together with the math necessary to understand them. He proposes to do that using this One Weird Trick,  'Most popular books assume that you don’t want to make the effort to follow the equations. Textbooks, on the other hand, assume that you don’t want to just understand the equations, you want to solve them. And solving these equations, it turns out, is enormously more work and requires enormously more practice and learning than “merely” understanding them does.'  And,... We are Off! Starting with first-year calculus and proceeding all the way to tensor calculus, Carroll teaches you the mathematical basis of classical physics, up to and including General Relativity.  I am a 66-year-old retired professor with a PhD in Applied Mathematics. There was little here that was new to me. (But I was happy to read because Carroll is an insightful thinker who frequently manages to tell me something I already knew but did not know I knew.) I asked myself, as one does, ""Who is this book intended for?"" And in a flash I realized, ""I would have loved this when I was in high school."" It would have been extremely challenging for sixteen-year-old me, mind-breakingly hard work, but in return I would have perceived (accurately) that I was being initiated into the Deep Magic That Makes The Universe Run. Mind blown, I'd have gobbled it down and asked for more.  There is almost nothing out there like this. Two other books come to mind, Roger Penrose's The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe and Leonard Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics. The Road to Reality is to 66-year-old me what The Biggest Ideas would have been to 16-year-old me: super-challenging, but full of insight. It is not accessible to most readers. As for The Theoretical Minimum, although there is a book, it originated as a series of truly excellent YouTube lectures, and should really be consumed in that form. It is aimed higher than The Biggest Ideas: Susskind assumes his watchers are facile with basic calculus. 16-year-old me would not really have been able to follow. It's also a big time commitment. I estimate the entire series comes to well over a hundred hours of lectures. This first installment of The Biggest Ideas took me two evenings to read, perhaps six hours, or, say, twenty when the full trilogy is available.  Some of the footnotes of The Biggest Ideas were a delight. For instance, I learned that Carroll is responsible for Natalie Portman's mentioning Einstein-Rosen bridges in the 2011 film Thor. Also, one footnote is a joke that literally made me laugh out loud. I will not spoil it.  Thanks to Penguin Group Dutton for an advanced reader copy. This review expresses my honest opinions."
B09NXV9W12047,B09NXV9W12,Sean M. Carroll,"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Space, Time, and Motion",sm,2022,4.0,38,"In reading the professional reviews of Carroll’s books I get the impression that he is the Carl Sagan of physics. His enthusiasm is palpable, his desire to bring physics into the mainstream is obviously sincere, and he makes a laudatory attempt to explain that physics is often, but not always, as advanced as the mass audience is often led to believe.  Contrary to what the Wall Street Journal writes in its Amazon review, however, this book is not “reader-friendly,” assuming, of course, you do not have an advanced degree in physics or some variation of advanced calculus. For the rest of us, it is a very challenging read. And while that is not meant with any disrespect to the author, who is obviously brilliant and sincere, it is a warning to any potential reader looking for a comfortable winter read in front of the fire.  I will, however, give Carroll great credit for not over-playing the hand of physics. He openly admits that physics, and by implication, science in general, is not the hard, granite-like “truth” that contemporary society often portrays it to be. “The science says” is often used today, with great exaggeration, in many news articles attempting to reinforce a conclusion that is far from conclusive in any final sense. Science is not like the ancient bone we dig up at an archeological dig. It is more like the conjecture we assign to that bone.  Science, in fact, is not a body of knowledge at all. It is a methodology, or the outline of one, for discovering knowledge. But it is the equation, not its solution. And it is an equation that can take many different forms. There is not one equation, or very, very few, that rise to the level of “law.”  Mathematics is no different. We didn’t “discover” it buried deep in the earth somewhere. We – humans – developed it. As the author notes, equations are “just a way to compactly summarize a relationship between different quantities.” And “A function is simply a map from one quantity to another quantity.” Mathematics, in other words, is simply a system or notation used to attempt to understand the world around us – emphasis on attempt.  As a result, there are several models of reality, all mathematically “sound”, but often burdened by gaps and even contradictions between models. As Carroll notes, “We don’t know the final laws of physics, so we should be open to different possibilities while we think about what they might be.”  And that, to me, is the money line of the book, which extends far beyond physics itself. “Science is empirical and fallibilistic – any of our scientific theories could be wrong, no matter how much evidence we have so far accumulated for them.” Which is why so many, and I do mean many, scientific theories are ultimately proven wrong and why things like clinical drug trials are often impossible to replicate.  I attribute this to the infinitely broad umbrella of context. Nothing that we can observe or measure exists in total isolation. Context cannot, and in my mind never will be, reduced to notation, no matter how complex that notational language may be. Context is of infinite breadth and, perhaps more importantly, depth.  Which is why I believe the title itself, with its use of the concept of “ideas”, is a bit inappropriate. Spacetime, to me, is not an idea. Beauty is an idea. Spacetime is a system for explaining one component of reality, but not, of and by itself, a piece of reality we found while hiking in the mountains. Ideas, to my way of thinking, are like shiny objects we discover in the rumpled fabric of reality.  Having said all that, this is a very sound book for the right reader. If you are not already proficient in the notational language of calculus and physics, however, you will find it a difficult read. I will confess, however, there are moments of entertainment if you define entertainment as anything that brings anything positioned “beyond” us down to our very human level of understanding.  Perhaps its greatest contribution, however, is that it does distill the greatest “laws” of physics posed to date into one modest-sized book. And it makes a valiant effort to tie them all together with a bow. That’s no small undertaking given that tomes have been written about most of them individually. For that the author is deserving of our thanks and our admiration and, if you’re up to it, our purchase."
B09NXV9W12048,B09NXV9W12,Sean M. Carroll,"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Space, Time, and Motion",sm,2022,3.0,20,"I have followed Sean Carroll for a long time. Loved all of his books. They contain lots of interesting physics and the text is not dummied down. So, I was eager to read The Biggest Ideas. Dr. Carroll promised to give us the ""real stuff"", equations and all, but written for people with no more math experience than high school algebra. I was on board! I am good at math. I learned every bit of algebra plus calculus and differential equations and a few other college math subjects. Plus, I really wanted to learn about quantum field theory and had always been warned that the math is too hard for mere mortals. Surely Sean Carroll, explainer extraordinaire, could come to the rescue!  I did pretty well for the first half of the book, keeping up as best I could given that the equations are in a tiny font that can not be enlarged on a Kindle e-reader. (For those who read on paper, Kindle is designed to allow the reader to choose the font, not the publisher. In this case, the publisher failed completely - not Sean Carroll's fault, but still a major blunder.) By the 40% mark, Sean had covered Space, Time, and now SpaceTime. All fascinating subjects and reasonable math (except for Laplacian and Hamiltonians which are just too obscure to fully understand).  Then the math got tougher. Matrices, partial differentials, and weird things you have never heard of like Rienmannian geometry. The explanation of big ideas quickly dissolved into ""let's derive Einstein's formula for relativistic gravitation from basic principles"". Ugh. I'd seen this before. A professor who cannot rest until every student learns what they know. I have never understood this delight in scribbling equation after equation expecting students to follow the logic. Sean was not as bad as some professors I have had, but once I had failed to understand a paragraph, I was lost for the remainder of the chapter.  To be clear, if you are a math wiz and have a lot of advanced mathematical constructs under your belt, you might be fine. But the promise of giving the ""real stuff"" to people with ordinary math skills never materialized. Unfortunately, there was also no chapter on Quantum Field Theory! So, I am still in the dark on that topic."
B09NXV9W12049,B09NXV9W12,Sean M. Carroll,"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Space, Time, and Motion",sm,2022,4.0,17,"Well, at least one reader was a hell of a lot smarter than me at 16. But, as I will be 70 in six months and am now a retired engineer with plenty of calculus, diff eq's, and linear algebra (matrices) well behind me, I could appreciate this book as a refresher course with the addition of a few new concepts that I had not realized previously (WRT momentum, eg.).  I am still enough of a nerd to have found this enjoyable. I liked the evolutionary descriptions from Newtonian to Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics. The break down of the inverse square law as a result of our 3 dimensional space, and area being 2 dimensional was pretty cool and made me have one of those well, duh, why did not I think of that before moments."
