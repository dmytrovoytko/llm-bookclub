B000FCJZ3G000,B000FCJZ3G,T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,bm,2009,3.0,123,"This book is average at best.  A big commercial for his seminars, which are mentioned at least 100 times.  You never learn how to diagnose your own ""money blueprint"" because of course you have to pay to go to a seminar for that.  This was a big let down. Also there were no chapters so without natural breaks it was really hard to read.  There are a few decent lessons and highlights to take away, but much less useful than most other highly rated money books."
B000FCJZ3G001,B000FCJZ3G,T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,bm,2009,1.0,27,"The comparisons between how rich and poor people think are offensive and wrong. There is so much classism in this book that it's hard to even read it. Dripping with privilege and entitlement - and completely unaware of it. Also, the value of RICH! is really off-putting to me. Yeah, it would be nice to be a millionaire, but I am not interested in falling into an endless cycle of greed, self-interest, and not caring about social/economic injustice or the people in need. The only good thing about this book for me was that it reminded me of my own values by showing me how I do not want to be."
B000FCJZ3G002,B000FCJZ3G,T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,bm,2009,1.0,9,"I have read the book after I attended the the millionaire mindset seminar, hoping that the book provide more knowledge and less promotion on his products:  Things I liked about the book: - The money jar theory  Things I didn’t liked about the book: - The most parts of the book he kept advertising his seminars, I have bought this book so the author provide all his knowledge and experience, but he kept referring to his other courses and seminars, which I already have attended before reading the book, which it was disgustingly on the way he and his team promoting for their books and courses,  Unfortunately, people like T. Harv Eker damage the reputation of the Self Development, by caring less about the value they provide and care more about their pockets and how they can use the people.  I’m big fan of self development, but when I hear the name T. Harv Eker, immediately SCAM word cross my mind"
B000FCJZ3G003,B000FCJZ3G,T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,bm,2009,1.0,8,"This book is entirely based around selling seats at his weekend seminar. It only scratches the surface of topics but never fully explore the concepts. No, that is done at the seminar that is so awesome, you will read that 100x so you will believe it through out this book. I got the book through a recommendation from a friend but i can not believe it cost money. There are much better books out there on the subject that are ad free and on the topic what you payed for. Does mazon have quality control? This is not a book, it's adverticement that you pay for and therefore, it's a scam."
B000FCJZ3G004,B000FCJZ3G,T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,bm,2009,3.0,5,"Overall, I really like the book. The author does help you think about things in a different light. However, I could not get over all the pitches for his seminars. Really, the seminar pitches would take me out of the book, and put me into ""commercial mode."" You know, when you think to yourself, ""When does this commercial end so we can get back to the content?"" I wouldnt let that stop you from buying the book, but just so you know, you will get a pitch for the seminar every couple of pages."
B000FCKPHG005,B000FCKPHG,Carol S. Dweck,Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,bm,2006,4.0,11,"The book has  a great message.  However, it is the same message chapter after chapter.  It goes through how the growth mindset is a better way than the fixed set mindset in sports, business, schools, sales, your personal life, etc.  Each chapter gives various examples of how the people with the growth mindset were supreme and the people with the fixed mindset were small minded and often cruel individuals.  While I agree with the books message it felt a little preachy at times. While there were parts that gave you 'questions to ponder' to help you change your mindset I would have liked a more concrete path.  I bought the book looking for direct ways to implement this in my life and the children I work with.  I felt it was over-filled with examples of 'good/bad' instead of mostly focusing on the technique of changing your mind set.  The book could have been greatly condensed.  I gave it 4 stars because I believe the theory/philosophy are sound and valuable enough.  The book itself I would really only rate a 2.  Watch the You-Tube video about the theory if you are in a rush.  You will understand it completely."
B000FCKPHG006,B000FCKPHG,Carol S. Dweck,Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,bm,2006,4.0,9,"This is a very important work because it focuses anew on how people approach and achieve challenge either through a fixed or growth mindset.  Actually, there are many books out there that touch upon these concepts, though they use different names for these concepts.  Carolyn Dweck however articulates this idea a little differently, even if the concept of mindset is nothing new.  Her writing style is very readable and clear.  Yet, I did find some of her examples problematic -- sometimes vague, and sometimes inaccurate.  She also at times fails to acknowledge how we can achieve a growth mindset when decision makers around us, who are of a fixed mindset, attempt to control how we must operate at the workplace or home, even when we genuinely seek to operate in the growth mindset.  I also did not like how Dweck waited until half way through the book to point out that each of us have aspects of fixed and growth mindsets in us.  Throughout the first half I was arguing with her, figuratively speaking, because I thought this was likely.  Still despite certain misgivings about how the book was written, I still thought it was a very important work.  I found it to be very provocative, as it elicited profound reflection, both personally and professionally in considering how mindset works in both realms."
B000FCKPHG007,B000FCKPHG,Carol S. Dweck,Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,bm,2006,3.0,9,"The core of this book - that people can change, and that focusing on effort instead of results can lead to improving the efficacy of your efforts - is quite good.  It suffers, though, from the way the narratives are framed.  Talent based outlooks are not presented as reasonable strategies chosen because they worked for a time, while effort based strategies are not presented as potentially dangerous because they can fail due to insufficient skill.  If a task is not in range of your present skill level, no amount of effort is going to magically change you in the short term, even if your long term prospects are good.  I do agree with Dr Dweck's overall point -  focus on improving your skills and putting in the effort to improve is going to have better outcomes than not doing so, but the book would have been improved by adding more focus on how to asses your current skill as compared to the task.  Even for someone in the ""growth mindset"", knowing how far you have to go will help you set your goals and timelines."
B000FCKPHG008,B000FCKPHG,Carol S. Dweck,Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,bm,2006,3.0,9,"I bought this book to help my daughter.  She has quite a serious issue with fixed mindset, so I got the kindle version, which I now realise was a mistake.  You see a kindle has this little tracker at the bottom of each page telling you how far through the book in terms of %.  I was so determined to help my daughter that I sat down and read the first 25% in a single sitting. The supporting material was great, I’d read about what fixed mindset looks like, why people think like they do, and why it’s a problem.  The next day I read the next 25%, lots more supporting information, and some examples about how this stuff can profoundly affect people’s growth, and how overcoming it can be profoundly life changing. Great! Next 25% of the book more of the same, but I figure you know maybe it’s just me, maybe some people take longer to understand the ramifications.  Then at about 76%, the book talks about a “brainology class” used across 20 schools and how amazing the results have been... finally I think to myself we’re getting to the payoff.... “obviously this brainology or mindset workshop was performed with a large staff and isn’t easy to replicate at scale” ... ok I get that, but you’ve come up with a way to adapt this workshop, right?  Two pages later... “the rest of this book will be about you!” Wait... what? By the fact that I picked up this book shows that either I already have a growth mindset and I’m looking to make it better, or I have a fixed mindset, but am looking to improve (also indicating that I’m aware of what needs fixing and want to grow)... so telling me to look at fixed mindset situations differently is great.... but how do I teach a child with a fixed mindset, that doesn’t realise they have a problem to change their thinking? It’s already been highlighted extensively in the book that people that don’t realise they have a fixed mindset, are unlikely to understand and appreciate the changes they need to make. How many psychologists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one, but the lightbulb has to “want” to change first!  So, if you’re one of those people that is aware they have a problem, know you need to change it, and are ready for the change, then this will be a great help (once you get past the first 75% of the book).  There is a part of the book that helps you guide your children to a growth mindset (between about 79% and 82%), and I’m super thankful for those pages, and will implement them with excitement and optimism, after that it slides back into having the reader think about things differently and focus on internal mindsets and self-help.  Then there’s a summary about how to progress your self-help and maintain your growth mindset.  The book is done at about 85% and the rest is notes, bibliographical references, and other appendices.  So I guess in summary, if we look at the sum total of the book (as 100%).  79% is supporting material, setting the scene; 6% is guidance (79% to 85%) and the remaining 15% is the usual supplementary material found at the end of non-fiction books.  Perhaps I’m being too hard here, I may have missed some real gold nuggets here, but I really started to struggle at 70%.  The book is solid and really helps you see fixed mindset for the damaging thing that it is (let’s face it if you don’t understand it after 75% of the book, then maybe you need to work harder at it) and really helps you see the trait in others, but ultimately I was overwhelmed with background, and underwhelmed with the self-help aspect."
B000FCKPHG009,B000FCKPHG,Carol S. Dweck,Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,bm,2006,5.0,5,"Self-help books seem to have this formulaic approach of drowning the reader in  areal world' examples of people and the binary outcomes of their actions without ever actually teaching the tools needed to make the changes you were hoping to learn through purchasing the book. Sadly, that was this book, too. I like the idea and I understand the concepts, but I was looking for TOOLS AND METHODS TO DRIVE CHANGE from a very fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Just how do you break life-long habits of thought that defines a personality? You will not get that from this book.  TL;DR: Fixed mindsets do not allow for growth, learning, and positive outcomes from negative situations. You can recognize a fixed mindset by being fixed in your mindset.  Update: Everything I said before about this book is still valid, and yet, I am so happy that I read and was receptive to the information it provided. I recognized so much of myself and my life arc in the examples I just wanted to know how to fix myself. Months later, I can honestly say that this book has changed my Mindset. It does appear that just recognizing fixed mindset patterns and behaviors is enough to make the change to a growth mindset. I have had a fixed mindset since I was a young child. Recognizing all of the issues and self- limitations that came with the mindset has set me free. It has made me a happier, more receptive person."
B000OT8GD0010,B000OT8GD0,Malcolm Gladwell,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,bm,2006,5.0,86,"Other reviewers have done an excellent job of reviewing the book’s thrust and content, so I’m going to assume I don’t need to do that here.  I do want to say I did not expect a scientific journal article. What I anticipated is what I got – a delightful application of fascinating social psychological evidence to ways of approaching and understanding real life problems.  With a degree in social psychology, I can’t help being excited and impressed by the research contributions of the field. The findings he cites often seem obvious and “of course” once the results are in. And sometimes the results contradict “common sense.” Always they require clever design by those who create the hypotheses and methods of measurement.  But this book does not claim to produce new research. What the author does is present interesting and validated findings in a way that organizes them for potential application to a given range of problems. Readers who want more scientific journal type evidence are free to take the suggestions and create their own statistically designed clever research.  As for me, his suggestions set me to thinking and observing life as it is lived. I will confess, I wish he had been able to identify a numerical tipping point. It would help me a lot in my efforts to create an epidemic of readers for my latest book. But maybe some of what I’m doing will be helped by thinking along the lines he suggests.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book – a good, thought provoking read."
B000OT8GD0011,B000OT8GD0,Malcolm Gladwell,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,bm,2006,1.0,18,"'The Tipping Point', or, as I am sure the author calls it, 'The book where I will tell people about these dudes I know and present a logical reasoning without a serious point or argument once in a while to make them think they are reading something worth their time', is, a complete waste of time. The author explores the causes of social epidemics and their influences by telling you about this time he met a rich guy in his penthouse. The guy knows people, so he controls things. People react to their environment. Things you likely know already but he will tell you about because he wants to talk  about this guy who helped him find this neat restaurant. The book does not make any arguments, and the parts were the author stops talking about his personal live are spent discussing some simple logical arguments that the reader will likely already be aware of. Did you notice how I repeated myself? That is every chapter of this book, except more boring and uninspired. Do not waste your time with this nonsense. Would give zero stars if possible."
B000OT8GD0012,B000OT8GD0,Malcolm Gladwell,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,bm,2006,3.0,13,"I thought this book was highly interesting at times and incredibly overdone and out-of-reach at others. By our of reach, I mean that the point got lost in the technical garble of the book. This was particularly true in the chapter about tobacco. However, there were some solid points in here that I think anyone in any profession would benefit from understanding and thinking about. For example, I used Gladwell's point about graffiti on the subway to fine tune my classroom management as a teacher. Overall, pieces of this book are valuable for certain people while others could be skipped by certain readers. It does not need to be a cover-to-cover read. Find the chapters that seem most suitable to your situation and skim the others."
B000OT8GD0013,B000OT8GD0,Malcolm Gladwell,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,bm,2006,1.0,8,"Did not see what the fuss was all about. Felt like a lot of common knowledge repackaged as Gladwell's own ideas. Messages take off when they are compelling and spread by influential, well-connected people. No s***."
B000OT8GD0014,B000OT8GD0,Malcolm Gladwell,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,bm,2006,2.0,7,"I realize I’m a little late to this book. It was published in 2002, and many of my friends have already read it. This is the second of his books I’ve read, and I find myself again slightly uncomfortable. I realize what was tolerable twenty years ago differs from today. So maybe he needs to update it. Or, just like something’s were always wrong, regardless of historical context, maybe it’s just wrong.  I have to wonder what Michelle Alexander would say to Malcolm Gladwell on his chapter talking about crime. This whole chapter in crime was triggering for me. I remember when Bernard Goetz killed those four youths. I remember him being glorified for murdering them in the name of vigilante justice. I remember him being let go. Despite his deep psychological issues, despite having committed four deadly crimes in the space of minutes in front of many witnesses, he was set free. Gladwell could’ve made his point without this example, where a White man was not held accountable for the four lives he took, all of whom were Black. And at the end of the chapter, he pretty much gives Goetz a pass for behaving in an excusable way given his environment. WtF!  He also uses examples where women are painted in sexist hues, using words and phrases like, “would she be able to handle everything by herself (financially, if her husband died)”, in another chapter, he uses the example of a woman, calling her “castrating.”  Then there’s the issue of class. He doesn’t define what constitutes a “good neighborhood” or a “good family” but says a juvenile’s success can be determined by both factors.  I was also deeply disturbed by his parallel between teen suicide in Micronesia and teen smoking in the Western Hemisphere. I really wish he’d used a different example. Suicide and smoking are not analogous in any context since the former results in a total and sudden loss of life, not to mention that there are too many cultural differences between Micronesia and the entire Western Hemisphere. They are simply incomparable. I say the same thing when he compared these same smokers to the school shootings that are so commonplace these days. They are incomparable. He should’ve used different examples, or he should’ve used just one rather than trying to compare them. Plus, I question the accuracy of his smokers’ profile, given there was no data to accompany it - just a British psychologist’s written observations from an undocumented time. Certainly, I don’t fit the profile, and I was a chain smoker for many years.  Some of the conclusions were illogical. Citing studies where one thing should be concluded by the absence of the other is not necessarily the right conclusion. You have to test the absent portion first. Without the second set of data, the first conclusion is exposed to fallacy. Maybe that absence was considered, but because he jumps to the conclusion without it, it makes me wonder of it was. It’s like saying you will lose weight if you stop drinking soda. Well, would that still be the only logical conclusion if you you were sick or you were increasing your exercise, or what if you increased your chocolate intake while eliminating soda? So this makes me question the soundness of the rest of his conclusions. It’s not to say I throw out everything he says, but it is to wonder how much of it I can trust. I might be more open to his analyses if the book had even one footnote. For all I know, this could be a complete work of fiction, because I have no references to fact-check.  If he were to update some of the sociopolitical contexts I mentioned and if he were to include how the tipping point works in social media, I would definitely be interested in rereading it."
B002Q6XUE4015,B002Q6XUE4,Simon Sinek,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,bm,2009,5.0,23,"While the majority of this book is about companies and the people who lead them, it is completely relatable to your personal life outside of work. Years ago, I worked for a company led by a man who clearly started with WHY. The company was bought out quite a few years ago, but my former colleagues and I still talk about the founder and the company with love and devotion. We describe it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that those who never experienced it could not possibly understand. My current company, which bought that former company, is much bigger so it's tough to compare, but I definitely believe that the leadership understands WHY as well.  I think everyone should read this book. Understand your company's WHY, your spouse's WHY, your children's WHY...and do not forget your own WHY.  #Farrakhan @simonsinek"
B002Q6XUE4016,B002Q6XUE4,Simon Sinek,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,bm,2009,3.0,9,"It's about WHY, but you got that during his TED talk, which mirrors the first 30 pages of this book. After that he repeats the same story over and over again to try and get you to believe what he told you in the first 30 pages. Disappointing is an understatement...almost like he forgot WHY he was writing it in the first place."
B002Q6XUE4017,B002Q6XUE4,Simon Sinek,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,bm,2009,5.0,8,"All habits are influenced by the environment and its triggers, according to Marshall Goldsmith. Influenced by what we are using our energy and attention for, where Greg McKeown teaches us to only focus on the essentials. They are influenced by our growth or fixed mindset, says Carol Dweck, which Susan Cain argues also influenced by our introvert-extrovert demeanor.  Moreover, any progress towards our goals depends on how we face what Steven Pressfield called the Resistance, in which Ryan Holiday suggest that they are in fact the way. It depends on how extreme we have ownership over our efforts, as illustrated by Jocko Willink, how we can screen through the cognitive biases described by Daniel Kahneman, and how we can fully utilize our brain's capacity as trained by Jim Kwik (mind), hack our body like Dave Asprey does (body), and approach it with a monk-like attitude as taught by Jay Shetty (spirit). And in the end, change, says Robin Sharma, is hard at first, messy in the middle, and gorgeous in the end.  But underneath them all, lies the very first foundation that keeps the structure of any effort or change to remain strong throughout the journey: the underlying reason, the life's calling, the fuel for the passion, the higher cause, the sense of purpose, or in short, the WHY. ""It is the cause, not the death"", said Napoleon Bonaparte, ""that makes the martyr."" And while our life's quests and struggles are not as extreme as life and death, without the WHY none of the above matters. This is WHY this book is so important.  Much to my pleasant surprise, this book is nothing like the contents that I’ve been accustomed to with the author, Simon Sinek, in his brilliant podcast interviews. While it is still based on psychology and its applications in sociology, it is heavily tailored to business, innovation, and its marketing approach, akin to Charles Duhigg's the Power of Habit.  And it fits. Because there’s arguably nothing that can illustrate the power of WHY better than business and innovation stories, from the ""cult"" of Apple and Harley Davidson, to why Honda need to create a second brand for their luxury cars, why TiVo failed to reach a tipping point, to how the Wright Brothers can invent the first aeroplane with no funding and minimum expertise while Samuel Pierpont Langley with his all star team and government funding failed to do so.  All of this are analysed with tools that can be applicable to anything in life. Tools such as the celery test, the school bus test, the golden circle, or the golden pyramid with the WHY-level at the top, HOW-level in the middle, and WHAT-level at the bottom.  Because when you want to lose weight and start living a healthy life, you need a WHY. If you want to stop smoking, you need a WHY. If you want to start up a company, volunteer to help the poor, pursue a PhD, train to win a race, enlist in a military service, organise a mass protest, or want your organisation to last for decades, everything need a strong WHY to keep the cause alive. And this book analyses it very well."
B002Q6XUE4018,B002Q6XUE4,Simon Sinek,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,bm,2009,2.0,7,"This book was a little short of original ideas. You could replace the ""Why"" of the title with VISION and it would have been a much easier read. The idea that a combination of a visionary and a practical manager can make a good team has been around for centuries."
B002Q6XUE4019,B002Q6XUE4,Simon Sinek,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,bm,2009,4.0,6,"The book repeats itself a lot. It lacks the clear structure we expect from someone as well known as Simon.  None of these are reasons not to read the book. Yes, it is the same message as the famous TED talk, but it explains the concepts in much more detail.  The book is written with a corporate slant but the reason you should read it is because between the lines you will find the inspiration to remember why the child that had been you, had dreamed about adulthood. It will inspire you to figure out why you are alive and going to work every day, and to begin to start every task with an understanding of why you are doing that task.  Whether you are leading a corporation or only yourself, you must start with your own personal why and this book will help you see why and how that must be done."
B002R2OFGY020,B002R2OFGY,Steven D. Levitt,"SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance",bm,2009,5.0,16,"As I read SuperFreakonomics it made me think about how folks process information and make decisions. Do the rationally think through the data they have and potential options? Do they respond to how the information or situation makes them feel emotionally? Do the react viscerally or relay on their gut instinct to drive their decision? The answer I think is all of the above, but everyone uses a different mix. This book is one in a series of readings over the last several years, which at a minimum, make me think and consider alternatives that are more data driven. I think that is what the authors were looking for a common theme.  I have seen many reactions to the stories in this book that are, well, heatedly negative. This book is driving for a more rational data driven set of explanations. It reflects the academic study of economics which try to explain and predict human behavior, both from a rational and emotional basis. The study tends to attract people like me, who tend to overemphasis data in decisions making. So can understand how it would repel people that tend to over emphasis emotions.  It is interesting however, how tremendous negative opinions have been pouring out even be before the release of the book this week. So as always, it is important to critically evaluate who is saying what, and determine for yourself why they are saying what they are. For me however, I think the authors have succeeded again at twisting and turning data in interesting and unusual way. They do it with a set of stories that are entertaining, sometimes provocative, but well researched and out of the ordinary.  SuperFreakonomics for me is a reflection and an extension to a couple of other books that talk about the relatively new ability for us to analysis and harvest information out of huge (and sometimes small) amounts of data. They talk about many of the same topics found in SuperCrunchers, The Numerati, and Outliers.  They definitely hit home with me on two thoughts. The first if the law of unintended consequences and second, the simplest solutions are often the best. Perhaps that IS the point of the book. We tend to look for complex answers and solutions. But the more complex and costly, the less economic value it has and the higher the probability of unintended consequences there is. These coupled with the human aversion to change, help explain to me some of the outrage to their analysis. Perhaps some are also reacting to ideas that are not in their personal self interest - hum, a common theme in economics.  I will not spoil the book with any descriptions of their stories. But I recommend that you give them a try, without any predispositions. Perhaps you will be rewarded with new simpler answers that you have not been exposed to before."

This is not supposed to be the definitive answer to global warming or too child safety. But it does make one consider and to look past all the politicking by Corporations, Scientists, and (of course) Politicians.  They do not consider themselves saviors or even to be the final answer. I see them as trying to liberate us from our self proclaimed boxes.  And that's what they do for me."

I think he really tries  to write  highly enlightening and useful books.  Except he does not.  This  book like his previous efforts is intended to help you get/keep your company ahead or build it to last.  The problem is despite all of his research Jim still  has little true understanding of the typical evolutionary pattern of a business space and therefore is unable to offer really useful lessons about how to outduel  your competitors and  get/keep your company  achieving it's full potential.  He is flying blind so he analyzes a bunch of super successful companies for common traits and concludes those traits are the key. But they are not.  That's why his super successful examples do not hold up over time.  He gives you tips that will probably help but far less important than other more strategic matters. By the way Jim it takes a lot of nerve to publish a book in 2011 that uses Apple as a control group/underperforming company-I do not care how you explain it, in the words of Len Berman of ESPN, c amon man.  Also,  the giant key to Admunson's success and Scott's  failure was smart innovation (dogs) versus dumb innovation( all of Scott's stupid ideas).  The 20 mile march rule was relatively far less important and now that's your big headliner.  That's  a great example of my main point.  I would agree that he is an excellent writer."

I love Jim Collins and have read his earlier books more than once, but this book was a disappointment.  It was like he had extra research (including some very good and inspirational stories) leftover from his previous books that he did not want to go to waste, and so he created concepts out of thin air in order to tie them together."
B007QWLLV2024,B007QWLLV2,Gino Wickman,Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business,bm,2012,4.0,44,"I was put off by the front end of this book. It struck me as too prescriptive - do this, follow these steps and everything will work out. As I read on, the model became more clear. I began to see connections between the author’s framework and that which I’ve read in similar books. That recognition made it clear that the foundational tools - trust, teamwork, leadership, commitment, vision, alignment, accountability, process, data, etc. - were as important to this author’s approach as they are to the approach that other others have crafted as their own. Whatever name you put on the package, the core principles are the same. I think that as long as the leadership team recognizes these building blocks and diligently assembles them, progress is achievable. With that in mind, the EOS framework has potential. With that in mind, the book has value, in my opinion."
B007QWLLV2025,B007QWLLV2,Gino Wickman,Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business,bm,2012,5.0,38,"So I have been in business some 16 years. I am an expert in my field and even on the bleeding edge of the field over the last few years. I have no formal business education so I studied for years at the school of hard-knocks to get my MBA. I have read every book I could get my hand on. I applied as much as I could, but my business struggled to grow to the size I wanted and needed in order to do the level of business I wanted to do.  I have read most of Michael Gerber's book based on the E-myth concept which I was certainly in. So for 5 to 10 years I worked on the business instead of in it. The big takeaway from all the E-myth books and even several E-myth Worldwide training I did. However as much as I understood the importance of processes and delegating and managing better I still struggled.  Then I had a friend recommend I read Traction and the partner book Get A Grip. WOW! This stuff really made it all click. The years of business study are all now being applied in a simple and manageable way. In the first 30 days of being introduced to Traction, I read it, listened to the audio version twice and read Get A Grip and listened to half of the audio version currently. On top of that I started applying the strategy to my business.  I have never been more focused and more clear about how to hit the big future goals I am going after. I know that over the next 50ish days (of Q4 year end) we will have this system up and running and my business will be in a place it has never been before… accurately predicting future projections, solving real problems and issues forever and growing at pace that we have never experienced before.  I have read Good To Great a few times and you know really struggled with figuring out how a small business like mine could define and create the 'right seats' so that we would understand how to attract and keep the 'right people' in those seats. Although I did not get this from Jim Collins book, the theory made sense. Implementation on the other hand was the challenge. Traction took the theory of Good To Great and made it applicable for me.  Now granted I also am now working with EOS Worldwide to roll-out these strategies faster, but that is the thing… Traction is all about application. The book is titled Traction for a reason, reading opens your eye to more than just business theory, it also delivers the tools you need to get traction. At least for my company it seems to be. I have only been at this for 30-40 days and things are sick. I mean we are seriously getting TRACTION! I can not wait to see where we are at in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 10 years. At this rate the future is looking pretty darn bright.  If you are a small business owner or small CEO that is frustrated with your company and feels like you have done it all and wasted a ton of cash and time trying every business theory and concept that came along and have little to show for it, then you may want to read Traction. This is the best damn business book I have read EVER! Only because it is real world and it give you more then theory, it actually gives you the tools you need to run and manage your business, your people, your clients, your profits and even your personal life (if you are working like a dog and missing family time, this book will help you get control of your personal life as well)! I highly recommend this book to anyone running a business that feels out of control."

Within the first four paragraphs the author declares his method will solve all your problems. He boasts about his expertise or the expertise of his mentors. Interestingly he first tries to demonstrate his bona fides by claiming he turned around and sold his family business. He then humble brags about his greatest mentor, his dad.  Hold on, did not you brag about ""turning around"" the family business? I guess dad was not that great.  The book is clearly in the family of books used to funnel more consulting business from executives who should not be in their seats and need to be seen ""doing something"". Numerous pages are little more than bullet points; I presume to bulk up the page count.  Give this book a pass: the author is conning you.

I am listeniing to my Audible recording of ""The One Thing"" for the third time.  Initially I was leery of the book, thinking it was riding a wave of hype.  It is not.  It is down to earth, practical advice about staying focused on the one thing.  Yes, it's a common message, but the authors here are intent on getting you, the reader, to make the belief a part of your daily life.  I personally find it to be like having a coach reminding me to concentrate my attention on that one thing, my main goal, and not to be distracted by all the other things clamoring for my attention.

What else can happen if you are working hard to bring your priority to life?  You give it more time than you will for other less important things! Most people know that (at least I would think so).  For the amount of information and new ideas in this book, it was waaaay overpriced.  $5.99 should have been its top price for this Kendle download.  The authors tried. They tried to put a different twist on things but failed.  I buy a book for good, solid information and new ways of doing things.  This book did not produce anything even close to exciting or new.

It came at a good time. i am 55 very organized and have been feeling that everything was getting disorganized in my life, but due to my necessity of controlling everything and getting everything done I have been compromising in doing more and more things until I reached a point where my to do lists got bigger every day and my done things fewer every day. So even before reading  this book I begun what I thought was procrastination as I have more and more mails I have not read and more and more work left for next day. I even begun shutting my office door for several hour a day to focus on my one thing's.

His own history, recounted in the book, shows just how irrelevant his own experience is to 99.9% of entrepreneurs.  This is a book for CEOs of VC-controlled startups. Its lessons are unlikely to apply to real businesses owned by--funded by--real entrepreneurs.  What makes sense for High Finance Entrepreneurship is usually suicidal for 99% of real businesses. VCs make their money by funding and promoting aggressively, and they do not care about losses. That's a luxury Main Street entrepreneurs cannot afford.  Finally, I would urge readers to be cautious of any advice given by a VC. It's typically self-serving and cannot be trusted.  I highly recommend spending time reading Michael Church's essays on VCs and VC-backed startups. __________________________________  We are in Bubble 2.0.

B00DQ845EA034,B00DQ845EA,Ben Horowitz,The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers,bm,2014,2.0,15,"Ben starts the book with insight into his own upbringing and it's engaging. But by the second or third chapter he's out of gas and resorts to rehashing every management book he's read -- including Andy Grove's -- into a mish-mash of generalizations that really do not help someone build a business.  Also, if you read Ben's blog or other info he comes across as egotistical. Maybe it's the way he writes but I find it overbearing and not helpful to really build my own business.  Further, if you have ever dealt with Andreessen Horowitz the venture capital firm it's just like many others: big hats and a few cattle. In other words, pretentious and self-important to the point of nausea.  Historically speaking, Loudcloud was a great idea that Ben gave up on too early. Yes, they sold Opsware to HP after some near-death experiences, but that does not mean it was the larger opportunity.  Had Loudcloud delivered on the vision it could have been along the size of Salesforce.com ... which is $30 billion market value today."

The description of the challenges that he faced in his day to day operations as CEO was scary. Just boils down to the fact that how hard a blow can you take and still keep going.  This book is not for the faint hearted for sure, and not everybody will be able to relate to it. Most of the things did not make sense to me because I have not been in those kind of situations in my life that Ben (and perhaps every CEO) has been through. Although Ben has repeatedly emphasized that there are no readymade answers to difficult problems that one faces in her professional career, he has pretty much laid out the blueprint for dealing with the typical challenges.  I am sure it will strike a chord with everyone who is an aspiring CEO or somebody who is already going through the grind. I think the book will stay in my bookshelf until life throws me in to 'CEO situation'  and then I will surely come back to pick the nuggets of wisdom lying all around in this book."
B00G3L1B8K036,B00G3L1B8K,Ryan Holiday,The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,bm,2014,5.0,488,"I looooove this book.  The ideas are not entirely new.  It's more like the author has taken the most important aspects of wisdom and compiled it into effective examples and phrases that really hit home.  I have underlined every page.  It's really helped me be less reactive, more intentional, more disciplined, and even keel.  I wish the book was longer and that there were more authors writing about this philosophy.  The premise is simple: focus your energy on the the things that are in your power to change, and do not waste your energy on emotional turbulence or hyper-analyzing everything. The reason this philosophy has the power to inspire so many more books is that it can apply to every aspect of our life: how and whether we muster the courage to make a change, how we drive our cars, how we schedule our days, what we choose to eat, how and whether we resolve conflicts.  One of the most helpful applications of this book is changing the ways I interact with my family of origin.  My parents and siblings are anxious, doubtful, and pessimistic.  For the most part, I am not.  However, for years I have struggled with my own reactions to being around them.  Every family holiday or vacation caused me to regress to adolescence, and after each event, it took weeks for me to recover.  Through this book, I realized that my reacting to their reactivity was totally ironic.  I do not have to react to them.  Once I became aware of this, it became a choice.  Now, I can choose to see these family events as opportunities to feel grateful for my own equanimity.  And when I do lose balance, I can be easy on myself, because I remember that new habits take a while to develop.  I can also choose to remove myself from environments that are not serving me.  Very empowering, very practical.  Thank you, Ryan Holiday!"
B00G3L1B8K037,B00G3L1B8K,Ryan Holiday,The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,bm,2014,3.0,196,"The premise of this book is great:  instead of trying to avoid obstacles or complaining about them, embrace adversity and learn to thrive in spite of it.  The first few pages were like an inspiring halftime talk from a football coach, and they had me excited and ready to take on the world.  As I delved further into the book, I found that the principles of Stoicism are incorporated in a smooth, teachable manner (so I did not feel like I was being lectured incessantly about Stoic philosophy) and each chapter starts out with a thought-provoking quote.  The author's writing style is direct and easy to understand, and multiple times I found myself highlighting a phrase I found impactful.  In spite of these assets, I ultimately felt that the book fell short.  Like his mentor Robert Greene, the author weaves in stories of famous historical figures to illustrate each lesson.  Unlike Greene's books, however, I found this book's analysis to be quite superficial.  For example, in the chapter titled 'Channel Your Energy' the author brings up Toussaint Louverture, the fascinating individual who led the only successful slave insurrection in history that led to the creation of a nation.  I was expecting an exciting tale from Louverture's life, yet the author simply referenced him for one paragraph to say that his name meant  nothe opening' because he was 'fluid' and 'uncontainable.'  That's it?  Why even bother to bring him up?  Many, many times the author would bring up a figure from the past only to mention a brief, shallow connection to the chapter's topic before re-engaging in his own pontification, which for the most part revolved around challenging the reader to stop 'playing video games' and get off the couch.  This might be good advice for some, but not every reader is sitting in front of a PlayStation wondering where life went wrong and awaiting a tongue-lashing from the author.  Although the writer has a good voice and I enjoyed his style, there were times where I thought the book could have benefitted from much better editing to tease out some of the fluff.  When I read the phrase, 'whatever you are doing, it's going to be harder if your plan includes defying physics or logic' I found myself thinking, 'no kidding?  I am glad I paid money to read this.'  Some of the stories were a little less than factual.  Was Antietam a huge victory for the Union in the Civil War?  It's been a while since I have taken a history course, but it was my understanding that Antietam is considered by most to have been a bloody stalemate.  Also, the author made a good point about Obama handling the Reverend Wright fiasco pretty well with a great speech, but I think it's a stretch to say this 'propelled' Obama into the White House.  I even found some of the author's statements to be contradictory.  When describing Jack Johnson's boxing match against the Great White Hope, he said Johnson was 'smiling, joking, playing the whole fight' in response to the racial tension of the crowd because  nothere's no value in any other reaction.'  Really?  Well then why did you praise Joe Louis just a few chapters before for making a point to show no emotion at all during his boxing matches, also in regard to racial tension?  Selectively choosing people or instances from history to back up your beliefs leads to inconsistencies, of which the book has many.  Demosthenes is praised for not giving up and becoming a great orator, but Jefferson is praised for giving up on becoming a great orator and instead focusing on writing.  Well, which is correct?  If you want to succeed in politics and are not a great orator, should you practice and never give up until you succeed, or acknowledge your weakness and focus on becoming a better writer?  The truth is, there are many paths to success and ways around obstacles, so many of these so-called principles or rules make sense in one context and are valueless in another.  Even so, the author deserves credit for putting together a considerable list of great quotes, providing an overarching yet flawed framework for applying Stoicism to your daily life, and occasionally saying something inspiring that prompts the reader to action and inspires the belief that obstacles are not to be cursed but embraced and overcome."
B00G3L1B8K038,B00G3L1B8K,Ryan Holiday,The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,bm,2014,5.0,178,"Before starting it, I was a bit concerned. Having read many of the works Ryan leaned on to write the book, thanks to being on his reading list for a few years now, perhaps there would be repetition of concepts I have already covered?  It turned out to be a fresh perspective. It centers on actionable lessons and tactics from stoicism.  ""It’s simple: a method and a framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting upon the obstacles life throws at us. ""  Telling someone to ""keep your cool"" and ""control your emotions"" is not bad advice. Yet, without context, it is hard to act upon. Ryan elaborates on the concept, providing examples of success stories throughout history.  He also points out that, when faced with a slight/setback, getting mad and taking the ""why me"" mindset is counterproductive. The idea, no matter how unjust or tragic the situation, is to calm down and to push your way through it. Examples from history, including Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Edison, show that our 2first century problems are usually minuscule in comparison:   ""... s*** that’s a lot worse than whatever we’re dealing with. I’m talking physical disabilities, racial discrimination, battles against overwhelmingly superior armies. But those people didn’t quit. They didn’t feel sorry for themselves. They didn’t delude themselves with fantasies about easy solutions. They focused on the one thing that mattered: applying themselves with gusto and creativity""  When it comes to battle, most of us believe confrontations to be direct and head-on, yet this almost always is not the case:  ""a study of some 30 conflicts comprising more than 280 campaigns from ancient to modern history, the brilliant strategist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart came to a stunning conclusion: In only 6 of the 280 campaigns was the decisive victory a result of a direct attack on the enemy’s main army. Only six. That’s 2 percent.""  We can all agree that having a lot of will (willpower) is a good thing. Yet, Ryan proposes that we may not understand what it really means:  ""Too often people think that will is how bad we want something. In actuality, the will has a lot more to do with surrender than with strength. Try “God willing” over “the will to win” or “willing it into existence,” for even those attributes can be broken. True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility.""  Two other desirable traits to have are persistence and perseverance. What is the difference? Persistence is oriented to a short term obstacle and perseverance is about the mindset for the long haul:  ""But a ten-year voyage of trials and tribulations. Of disappointment and mistakes without giving in. Of checking your bearings each day and trying to inch a little closer to home—where you’ll face a whole other host of problems once you arrive. Ironhearted and ready to endure whatever punishment the Gods decide you must, and to do it with courage and tenacity in order to make it back to Ithaca? That’s more than persistence, that’s perseverance.""  ""Persistence is an action. Perseverance is a matter of will. One is energy. The other, endurance.""  In conclusion, every obstacle is an opportunity. Turn ""s*** into sugar"". Ryan does a fantastic job showing ""philosophy’s true use: as an operating system for the difficulties and hardships of life ...""​  I am already applying learnings from this book against my own obstacles."
B00G3L1B8K039,B00G3L1B8K,Ryan Holiday,The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,bm,2014,1.0,89,"This book is a formulaic representation of someone trying to write about something they have just stumbled on and not lived with.  It uses a handful of disconnected anecdotes to draw on conclusions that are out of context and supported by nothing but the author's ongoing fiction and cheer-leading.  It reads like a long essay, written by a freshman whom then sat and had help from an array of peers whom tried their best to paraphrase the writing, initiating changes and hoping the final audience would not notice their substitutions of the author's original prose.  And it would have succeeded if the author did not shoot himself in the foot in the last, unedited paragraphs, where he talks of his inspiration and gives thanks; where not only does he summarized the entirety of the book without the repetition found in the rest of the book's body, but also paints you an entirely different picture of himself than the rest of the book.  The cringe-worthy straw that broke the camel's back was the author's self-serving admiration for his girlfriend going and buying his book after dating for only a couple weeks.  Where like most, I probably read that thought and hit a mental wall that cracked the image the author portrayed of himself, and made you feel foolish for buying into the farce.  But the worst thing I could say about this book is rather that its deceit in false usefulness, and encouragement and display of narcissism, run so boldly in contradiction to stoic values that you too might have a physical reaction.  The truth of the matter is that if reader desires to posses for themselves a sense for stoic philosophy and practicality, they are much better served by going to the sources, such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Aurelius, whom are not just highly accessible but infinitely enduring.  Their messages served from infinitely less 'on high' than this book, which rather beats you over the head with sentences you'd expect from a marketing department at Macy's, betting equally on the buyer's narcissism and trying to sell adequacy through merchandise.  In the end, this book is a lesson, that no amount of well-intentioned editors can compensate for an author not having coherent thoughts and messages themselves."
B00G3L1B8K040,B00G3L1B8K,Ryan Holiday,The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,bm,2014,5.0,59,"Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way is a superb primer on the Stoic principles. For one thing, at 224 pages, it is less than half the size of the last book I read on the same theme, Derren Brown’s superb Happy. This is by no means a bad thing, however, for while Brown’s book delves into the history of Stoicism and man’s eternal search for that which will make us happy, Holiday’s is a quicker, lighter read, but one that packs a hell of a punch.  The gist of the book is that if one applies the principles of Stoicism carefully and mindfully, then no matter what happens (good, bad, or indifferent) then it becomes possible to deal with the highs, lows, and plateaus of life with equal poise and calmness. Obstacles, Holiday posits, represent opportunity, and should be welcomed rather than feared, for they offer us chances to grow and become more than we currently are.  There’s nothing really new here, and I say that without being critical. The tenets around which Holiday builds his case are thousands of years old, being drawn primarily from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, among others. The great success of the book is its ability to distill these concepts down into usable, everyday ways of thinking which can benefit each and every one of its readers, if they are disciplined enough to apply them to their own lives. It points out (quite correctly) that the problems faced by the average Greek or Roman citizen were, at their core, fundamentally no different than the ones that vex us today, for they are based upon the same old negative emotions: fear, jealousy, anxiety, greed, a desire for celebrity, and so forth. Marcus Aurelius, one of Rome’s five so-called “Good Emperors,” wrestled with all these issues and more on a daily basis, and used Stoicism in order to successfully conquer them…and himself. There are very good reasons why Meditations is still read so widely (and re-read so frequently) today. I have returned to the book regularly ever since I discovered it as a teenager, and will probably do so for as long as I live. These truths are timeless, and invaluable.  Holiday refers to the Stoic philosophy as “an operating system for living,” which seems very apt in this digital day and age. If that is indeed the case, then The Obstacle Is the Way serves as an introductory manual for that operating system, a primer that helps one get to grips with how it works. Some of the complexity and nuance may be left out or abstracted, but the thrust of it is covered succinctly, with plenty of easily understandable contemporary examples to clarify things.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who could use a little help in dealing with the stresses and strains of everyday living…and at the end of the day, isn’t that all of us?"

Covey,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Infographics Edition: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,bm,2016,2.0,1208,"I finally decided to read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  I had purchased it some time ago and recently determined that now was the time to read this self-help classic.  What a COLOSSAL disappointment!  I am amazed that this mediocrity is so popular.  I found it to be little more than 1980s managerial balloon juice.  From “paradigm shift,” to “think Win/Win,” to (ugh) “synergy,” there is no empty self-help cliché left unturned.  I should have stopped reading the first time I saw the word “synergy.”  (I get countless “business proposals” in my email every day and, if I bother to skim any of them at all, I delete them as soon as the word “synergy” makes an appearance.)  No word represents the trite emptiness of this book better than “synergy” – except maybe the verb form of the word: “synergize,” or the adjective “synergistic,” or the adverb “synergistically.”  But they are all here.  (The author also repeatedly refers to “things that are learned” as “learnings.”)  The book doesn’t even try to live up to its title.  There is no argument at all to support the idea that these are seven actual habits that real people have used anywhere in the world to achieve real success.  In fact, these seven so-called habits appear to be nothing more than seven things that the author thinks are really good ideas, with weird examples of how they helped him deal with his kid being bad at baseball and also helped his kid learn the value of cleaning up the yard.  The book’s title doesn’t match the book itself, but then no one would spend their money on a book called, “The Seven Things Some Random Guy Thinks are Really Nifty-Keen.”  Here’s some useful self-help/time management advice for you: do not waste your precious time with this book.  There are dozens and dozens, if not hundreds, of better self-help books out there.  Synergize your win/win paradigm shifts with some of those."

We have the seven habits, the circles of concern/influence, the p/pc balance, there's no control/direct control/indirect control, private victories/public victories, proactive focus/reactive focus, genetic/psychic/environmental determinism... And I am still on Habit One. It's confusing, and the wording/sentence structures have me reading almost every sentence several times before I can even somewhat comprehend them. I am fairly intelligent, but surely the following quote could have been worded a little less...snobby? ""The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person."" It's almost like he's trying to make us feel inferior.  I wanted to love this book, I REALLY wanted to. I once told someone ""I will never stop trying to be a better mom"" and I recognize that that means I have to never stop trying to be a better PERSON first, but after reading just 22% of this book, I still do not completely understand what he was trying to get across. I will not finish it. And I pray I am never asked to define ""paradigm"" for anyone. I have come across it a hundred times so far, and still could not give even a vague example."
B014DUR7L2043,B014DUR7L2,Tahl Raz,Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It,bm,2016,5.0,1204,"My guess is around 70% of my purchases are made on Amazon: it's a lot of stuff, both for home and for my company. This is the first item (across all categories) that I have written a review for. I am compelled because this book has changed my life, and I suspect it can change yours — What do you have to lose by reading it?  I thought I’d learned what I needed to know about negotiation. I went to a prestigious business school and took their negotiation class, learning all about Getting Yes, BATNA, and other fancy acronyms. I’d also had to bargain my share in both work and personal life. Yet, I felt like the tools I’d been given were meant for some alternate reality where people are totally dispassionate, rational robots, doing math in their heads to get to logical outcomes. The negotiations I’d been in with were instead with passionate, irrational (including myself) humans, sometimes getting angry or sad, often making decisions that didn’t “make any sense” (to me). I was pretty sure the negotiation outcomes we were getting to were subpar, both for me and for them: a lot of splitting the difference, mostly to make the negotiations — which felt uncomfortable for all parties — stop.  Note, when I mean “negotiation”, I’m speaking pretty broadly: from “negotiating' with my fianc&eacute;e on who should walk the dog tonight, to negotiating with an employee on why this feature needed to be built urgently, to negotiating with an angry customer who’d called me angry about something, to negotiating with my parents on wedding plans, the list goes on. Each negotiation tougher and more emotional than the next, yet with tools that told me emotions didn’t matter. Huh?  I don’t remember how I came across Never Split the Difference, but man, am I glad I did. The book exposed me to a whole different way of negotiating, questioning the rational toolkit I’d been given in business school and replacing it with a more human set of tools. This set based on psychology and understanding of normal human emotions. It builds on empathy and active listening skills, layers on ways to label emotions and ask open-ended calibrated questions. It includes polite ways to say “no” without offending the other party, and many more. Most importantly it builds a framework that lets you deeply understand what the other party needs, wants, and desires, and work with them to achieve an outcome where you get your goals met — without ever “splitting the difference” again.  And it has worked wonders. Since reading this book, I have: - Forged a better relationship with my fianc&eacute;e by actively listening to her before jointly finding solutions - Negotiated successful resolutions to emotionally charged topics with parents and friends - Brought angry customers — who felt we had failed them — back from the brink to trusting us again - Forged a better relationship with my business partners by understanding how they value time, silence, relationships, surprises, etc… - Gotten discounts on things that I didn’t think could be discounted, just by using my name - Gotten to the front of the waiting line at busy restaurants - Said no to bad deals, because no deal is better than a bad one - the list goes on.  I warn you that this book is the start of a rabbit hole that you might want to keep digging down. I’ve recommended this book to anyone who will listen, personally bought it 29 times as a gift for friends & coworkers alike, taken an online class (taught by the author’s son, a brilliant negotiator in his own right), etc...  Negotiation, in the broadest sense as described above, is something I want to become an expert in, because I now understand that every conversation is a negotiation. This is likely the most useful skill you can learn and apply.  It all started with this book. Are you too busy to read it?"
B014DUR7L2044,B014DUR7L2,Tahl Raz,Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It,bm,2016,5.0,564,"WHY THIS BOOK MATTERS: We negotiate or persuade dozens of times a day. Then there’s the big stuff that changes the course of life: getting a raise; landing a job offer; buying a car or house. Most of us had no formal training in negotiation, or were taught incorrectly. This book is your secret weapon for mad success. MAIN CONCEPT: Tactical empathy: “This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person.” IS IT FUN TO READ: Finished it in a day. The book’s full of riveting life-and-death hostage negotiations, and Voss spins a damn good yarn. OKAY, BUT IS IT USEFUL?: I highlighted 109 passages and took 20pp of single-spaced notes. There is so much crazy useful stuff in this book that it would be a bargain at 100x the price. For example, Voss advocates getting to “No” before getting to “Yes.” To those schooled in academic negotiation, this may seem heretical. But it makes all kinds of sense: letting your adversary say a solid “no” gives them a feeling of safety, security and control -- a great starting point to a negotiation. The technique of asking calibrated open-ended questions is pure gold (e.g. “How do I do that?” or “What’s important to you about that?”) Funny thing is that I’ve been teaching that technique for years, but only now understand *why* it works so well (thanks, Chris!). Then there’s the step-by-step protocol for negotiating your salary and the 6-step Ackerman bargaining model. There’s mirroring: you repeat people’s words verbatim, so they feel understood. There’s labeling, where you identify the emotion behind what people are saying, thereby deepening empathy. Great quote: “Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.” What I really like about this book was that its techniques were honed by real-life negotiations with actual bad guys. During his 24 years as FBI Lead Hostage Negotiator, time and time again Voss got people released from the grips of determined terrorists and kidnappers. If the techniques work in those critical situations, surely they’re good enough to help you negotiate a raise. In the end, this is a book about not just being good at negotiation, but being great at life. “Never Split the Difference” is serious wisdom, every bit of it earned, conveyed with great humor, storytelling and insight. Read it to be a more effective human. -- Ali Binazir, M.D., M.Phil., Happiness Engineer; Speaking Coach, KNP Communications; author, [[ASIN:0977984575 The Tao of Dating: The Smart Woman's Guide to Being Absolutely Irresistible]]"
B014DUR7L2045,B014DUR7L2,Tahl Raz,Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It,bm,2016,5.0,98,"I am a nonprofit fundraiser. Splitting the difference has become the rule in my field, not the exception or the back up plan, but rather the strategy for going into any meeting with a potential major donor. This book really gave me new courage to ask for bigger asks, and lots of newfound self confidence in going to my next donor meeting.  Among the biggest takeaways for me were the following: 1. tactical empathy-- getting your donor to a  nothat's right' but not 'you are right' epiphany. 2. Calibrated questions - Saying no without using the word no by responding to offers with a question that keeps the conversation fluid. 3. No deal is better than a bad deal. 4. Never be ignored on email again by playing to a person's natural aversion to failure.  For those of you also in nonprofit development, point 3 above probably sounds like heresy. We have been told it's often better to leave with something rather than nothing. However, so long as you utilize Voss' steps towards tactical empathy, I can now see how walking away from a bad deal can help lay the brickwork for the better deal down the road. Like business clients, donors just want to feel validated. They want to know that we as the asker understand their motivations and desires.  Immediately after finishing chapter 5, I deployed the tactics discussed on a donor who had simply stopped talking to us. Within 2 hours I got a response that allowed us to continue an open dialogue. I had a 'Holy Sh!t' reaction, the type of reaction that Voss himself mentioned on a few occasions in his book, to just how well a simple 1 lined email worked to get a response. Thinking it was a fluke, I tried it again on another donor who we stopped hearing from. Got a response from him at the end of the day with a planned meeting in the works!  My one major regret is buying this on Kindle rather than a physical paperback copy. This is a book I would keep on my desk, marked with highlights, comments, dressed up with post-it flags, just to browse through and reference before every future major donor meeting or encounter."
B014DUR7L2046,B014DUR7L2,Tahl Raz,Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It,bm,2016,3.0,50,"Chris Voss is a great storyteller, and has some real 'wow' moments in this book, both in terms of the kinds of events he has been involved in as a hostage negotiator, and also in terms of some of the results he achieved.  That said, his experiences have limited relevance for, say, the sales rep whose prospect is not trapped in a building surrounded by snipers. Chris's  'Keep them talking', constant-discovery, open-ended-question techniques are great in life-or-death scenarios where both sides are forced to interact with one another. But in most real-life negotiations, one side or the other can simply say  nothanks, but I am not interested, please do not call again,' and hang up the phone.  If you are in a locked-room type scenario, where you have to negotiate until a resolution is reached, this is a great book, and has great insights for how to get the best outcome. But if you are dealing mostly with people who can hang up on you at little or no immediate risk of death or other serious personal consequence, then it's mostly a  notips 'n tricks' compilation, like a thousand other books full of fun stories and interesting ideas."
B014DUR7L2047,B014DUR7L2,Tahl Raz,Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It,bm,2016,3.0,41,"Not sure I buy the logic of NEVER splitting the difference. As a customer in a negotiation, I wouldn’t tolerate that; I remember, years ago, abruptly walking out of a car dealer for this specific reason. The salesman stubbornly refused to split the difference: guess what? See ya! (To be noted that I was a car that I really liked and was prepared to buy regardless, but his resolution to not give in, really annoyed me). I walked out, went to a competitor dealer (who did split the difference) and got the same car at the price that I thought it was fair."

This is a book that says and repeats and then repeats and then builds upon the idea of coaching by using the 'ask questions' technique.  If you know of a guy named Socrates you already know this approach. If you and Socrates are not yet acquainted, he taught by asking questions - which caused students to think.  Think about this ... when coaching someone rather than say 'here's how you do that' you say 'so how do you think this should be done?'  then as they answer lead them thru a sequence of '... and if you did that what would happen?'   nothat may work, but have you thought about ____?'

B01HNJIJB2055,B01HNJIJB2,Ryan Holiday,"The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living",bm,2016,5.0,347,"I have been a fitness nut all my life, yet last year a combination of a reaction prescription drugs and latent back problems landed me on crutches...two back surgeries, 9 months now of physical therapy and still walking on two canes.  Half of each day is spent in physical t herapy, and no one knows whether nerve damage will recover.  I have my own consulting business, and I have avoided face to face meetings for fear of the reaction of clients and competitors to my physical infirmities...loss of business, loss of income, loss of lifestyle, loss of image, on and on.  It was all getting deep into my head.  Last week I heard Barry Ritholz on Bloomberg interview Ryan Holiday and discuss this book, which I promptly purchased.  It has helped immensely in a single week to refocus and avoid a total flame out.  I read the Stoics in college and later, but they never 'spoke to me' like they do now.  It is fundamentally a philosophy of coping.  I still hang on to Charles Spurgeon, but so much of that is about what comes later; I needed something to help me with today.  Interestingly, in reading through it (and half a dozen others I purchased since then), I have pondered how much we have drifted from our Graeco-Western traditions.  The Founding Fathers were steeped in this stuff, but somewhere along the way we have all become tethered to the whims of feelings, including other's feelings, and the Stoics had the solution to these thousands of years ago.  I can not control those, and so I do not allocate my precious limited resources to them.  So I work around them.  Adapt.  The Media in this country inundates us with such distraction (the topic of another book by this author, which I also bought).  What would a Stoic say to someone who says they 'do not feel safe?'  Probably tell them to take action within their control to be safe and give up on demanding that the entire world respond out of guilt, badgering or whatever to appease your feelings.  And then the Stoic would get on about his business.  Its a great, and dangerous, little book.  Thank you, Mr. Holiday, for bringing it back in an easily digestible format."
B01HNJIJB2056,B01HNJIJB2,Ryan Holiday,"The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living",bm,2016,5.0,66,"In the interests of full disclosure, I have not read the entire book, since it is formatted as a daily devotional reading, rather than a chapter to chapter offering.  Having read the wonderful introduction, I selected some random portions for review and started with October, bringing myself up to date.  The selection of Stoic verses is apt, and the book sticks to broad and cohesive themes throughout each month such as Virtue, Courage and Acceptance.  It's not the translations that are important (I am not a linguist and they seem fine to me), but rather the guidance offered by the authors in putting the principles into practice.  I do not often make reading recommendations to my college-aged children, but I am going to strongly encourage them to read this book.  It's a certain antidote to today's Outraged Victim Morality.  If we all adopted a more Stoic philosophy, the world would be a kinder, gentler and more fulfilling place."
B01HNJIJB2057,B01HNJIJB2,Ryan Holiday,"The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living",bm,2016,1.0,40,"I really wanted to love this book. I LOVE the idea of a daily digest book for approaching a topic, but they seem to be rare aside from religious ones. I made it halfway through February before throwing in the towel. The monthly themes are not bad, and the quotes included each day from the three ""founding fathers"" of stoicism (Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca) really should be the meat of the daily reading, but the author comments on them in the most baffling ways so that each day I was left getting mixed messages. The author's interpretations of the quotes are often superficial, illogical, biased, preachy, and full of irrelevant anecdotes, leaving me unable to focus on or reflect on the original stoic quote presented each day, as I am too distracted by Holiday's inane ramblings.  An apple is a fruit. An apple is red. A balloon is red. Therefore a balloon is a fruit. This is the kind of childlike logic pattern I often saw in this author's opinions on stoicism before I threw in the towel and stopped reading this book, realizing I had made the grave error of not starting with the three core stoic texts before reading a book where an author interprets stoicism. I will be reading the Gregory Hays translation of Aurelius's Meditations from here on instead of The Daily Stoic, which I will not continue to read. From there I will read Epictetus and Seneca and see if I even need to read another book that ""interprets"" them.  Today's entry was really what put the nail in the coffin for me. February 10 ""Anger is Bad Fuel."" (It's bad, mmkay?) in which Ryan Holiday writes:  ""Many successful people will try to tell you that anger is a powerful fuel in their lives. The desire to ""prove them all wrong"" or ""shove it in their faces"" has made many a millionaire. The anger at being called fat or stupid has created fine physical specimens and brilliant minds. The anger at being rejected has motivated many to carve their own path. But that's shortsighted.""  Okay Ryan Holiday. I am listening. Tell me why.  ""Such stories ignore the pollution produced as a side effect and the wear and tear it put on the engine. It ignores what happens when that initial anger runs out and more and more must be generated to keep the machine going (until eventually the only source left is anger at oneself)."" Oooo assumptive metaphor. How dazzling.  He goes on to share a MLK Jr. quote about hate and says hate and anger function in the same way and are ""toxic fuel"", ""never worth the costs that come along with it."" I do not think it's a fair comparison or we would not have two separate words for them. Who is this Ryan Holiday to judge whether the successes of others that were fueled by anger were ""worth it""? Well, he's not going to tell us. Who knows who he is, or why we should be listening to his interpretations of ancient Greek masters. This guy is an armchair pundit taking cheap shots at others for finding their own roads to success, often against great odds, against abuse, racism, sexism, ableism, and bigotry of all kinds. Who says a little anger can not be channeled in a healthy manner or turned into something greater? I am all for being convinced, but this author does not understand logic, so he does not even try. It's all preaching, opinion and daft metaphors. Time to visit the core texts of stoicism and move on.  The only way I could see The Daily Stoic being useful is if you have already read the core texts of stoicism and just want a bite-sized quote from them each day to reflect on, and ignore the author's spin on them. This book is trying to turn stoicism into a pop culture novelty. If you are religious, do not like to confront your thoughts and figure them out logically, and just like being told what to think and believe by someone who *seems* smarter or more put-together than you, this book might work for you, but if you require a firm argument and logic to believe something, look elsewhere. This is rubbish. I wish you could get refunds on digital books that turn out to be of poor quality."
B01HNJIJB2058,B01HNJIJB2,Ryan Holiday,"The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living",bm,2016,4.0,35,"The philosophical school of Stoicism may have been born in the third century BC, but it has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years. In modern times, Stoicism served as the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy, a psychotherapeutic technique used to treat depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, and other mental maladies. Many contemporary would-be Stoics, however, prefer to bypass CBT entirely and go straight to the source for their life-coaching by using the writings of the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome as the basis for a guide to living. With all the Stoic self-help books published in recent years, it was only a matter of time before one utilized the “daily affirmations” format. Such is the strategy of The Daily Stoic, published in 2016. The book was written by Ryan Holiday, a former PR man and marketing director, and Stephen Hanselman, a publisher and literary agent with a master’s degree in philosophy.  As the title of the book indicates, The Daily Stoic delivers 366 mini-lessons in Stoicism, dated January first through December 3first. These daily entries are divided into months, each revolving around a different theme, such as “Passions and Emotions,” “Duty,” “Fortitude and Resilience,” and “Virtue and Kindness.” Each daily lesson begins with a quotation from an ancient Stoic—most commonly Epictetus, Seneca, or Marcus Aurelius, but the authors also include selections from less familiar Stoics like Musonius Rufus, Cleanthes, and Zeno (the latter quoted from Diogenes Laertius’s Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers). Holiday and Hanselman then provide a page or two of elaboration on the quote and how it applies to the problems of modern life.  Overall these daily Stoic meditations are really quite well-written. The authors are adept at taking ancient Stoic concepts and translating them into plain English without dumbing-down the philosophical content. Holiday and Hanselman certainly know their stuff and write about Stoicism knowledgably and intelligently. They often use examples from history or current events to illustrate the points made in the ancient quotes, which keeps the text interesting and relevant to 2first century readers. If you have already looked into Stoicism, chances are you’ve probably already read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius or the Discourses of Epictetus, but this book will help you see those texts in a new way. Occasionally, the lectures sometimes veer into what one might call “self-help shaming,” implying that if you’re not living your life to the fullest, then your life is a waste. Such instances read more like a 2first-century conceit than what the Stoics had in mind when they promised a life of tranquility. Overall, however, I found the book quite insightful and useful.  Though I believe in Stoicism and its benefits for mental and emotional health, I did not diligently stick to the lesson-a-day schedule the book prescribes. Sometimes I got bored with The Daily Stoic and let several days go by without picking it up; sometimes I would enthusiastically devour half a month’s worth of entries in one sitting. This is not the best book I’ve read on Stoicism (William B. Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life is hard to beat), but it is better than most. If you are serious about Stoicism, these daily contemplations on Stoic thought can be a useful tool to augment your studies. Having just finished the book with the end of the calendar year, I’ll probably just go back to the beginning and read it all over again."
B01HNJIJB2059,B01HNJIJB2,Ryan Holiday,"The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living",bm,2016,5.0,31,"I almost wrote “Life changing…if you let it” but that implies less commitment on your part. The thoughts and principles that Ryan Holiday writes about are timeless and literally life changing. That said they aren’t necessarily easy. They require introspection, change, and yes, WORK at times. It’s worth it though. YOU are worth it. Aren’t you?  I wish I had discovered Stoicism 30 years ago when I was a young man just starting my life and career. The good news is I can pass this on to my children and grandchildren.  I have made gifts of several of Ryan’s books to family. Ryan puts the Stoic philosophy into a more understandable and relatable for the modern world. Stoicism is no less important now, in fact I would argue ar argue it is"

On paper, this would figure to be a pretty boring book. I mean, not many people are going to expect a book about to-do lists to be riveting reading. But Damon Zahariades is an exceptionally gifted writer. And he pulls it off nicely. Even for such a dry topic as to-do lists.  In a nutshell, Damon clearly explains exactly why most people's approach to to-do lists end up in futility and failure. Then he provides the steps you can take to transform your to-do lists into powerful time-saving tools. But he does not stop there. Damon also examines the 10 Most Popular To-Do List Systems from top to bottom. Advantages and pitfalls. And then helps you decide which is best for you.  It's an excellent and very thorough how-to guide. The only thing lacking are examples of the various to-do list systems in action. A few graphics or visuals could have helped with the big picture. Even so, that omission is not that big a deal.  By the way, the rest of this review is a bit nostalgic. So you can skip this portion if you like.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see Damon Zahariades' name pop up here on Amazon. We go way back. Not as in personal friends. More like a comforting blast from the past. Damon was around way back in the early days of Internet Marketing when us old-timers used to happily shell out $47 bucks for PDF How-To 'ebooks'.  I was on Damon's email list and thoroughly enjoyed his entertaining style of writing. He could make dry marketing topics sound like a big-time edge-of-your-seat Hollywood thriller. I even purchased a $47 'ebook' from Damon called The Special Report Bible. Mainly because I wanted to pay him back for all the excellent content he provided in his newsletters.

B01KT104RI065,B01KT104RI,Eric Barker,Barking Up the Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong,bm,2017,5.0,237,"This is the first book I have ever pre-ordered. I am a regular reader of the blog Barking Up The Wrong Tree, and I once thought would it be cool if Eric Barker can make a book out of these gems? And my God he did, and it did not disappoints one bit.  Like Dale Carnegie, Eric Barker uses so many stories, book references and great quotations to make his points across. There are stories such as how a poor boy in Mexico can become a world class neuro surgeon, how a clinically crazy person can win the enduring Race Across America, or how can an illiterate person in a horrible time and place and without proper education can conquer more land in 25 years than the Romans ever did in 400 years. There are also eye opening stories of how trust is completely lost in a Moldovan culture, how crimes create street gangs (and not the other way around) for protection, and how surprisingly civilised and organised pirates were.  The author then back them up with numerous scientific findings to validate the points he is making, just like the approach of Daniel Kahneman. For example, there are scientific explanations on why some people never quit, why people have depression, and why people commit suicide. Moreover, there are explanations on why high achievers can sometimes have anxiety problem or even depression, why the number ones in high school (the valedictorians) so rarely become the number ones in real life, why beautiful people normally becomes more successful, why nice guys finish first and last (and not in the middle), and why high achievers are rarely active in their social media accounts.  Along the way we will learn so many amusing facts, such as how an IQ of 120 does not make much difference than 180, 2 and a half to 4 hours after we wake up is when our brains is at its sharpest, how Hedonic Adaptation explains why after a brief change everything change back to baseline (e.g. on diet and clean behaviour), how viagra started out as a medicine for angina that had a serendipitous 'side effect', that the US once had an (almost official) emperor, Emperor Norton I.  And we will also gain some great wisdom like 'sometimes an ugly duckling can be a swan if it finds the right pond' or 'life is noisy and complex, and we do not have perfect information about others and their motives. Writing people off can be due to just lack of clarity', or  nothings are not as scary when we have our hands on the wheels.'  All of these wealth of information are then knitted nicely to become the central theme of the book: to discover the core determinants of success, through considering both sides of the argument with extreme stories and scientific facts.  In each individual chapters the book then provide concluding analysis, such as the importance of quiting something that is not good for you to make room and time for something good for you, the scientific explanation on luck as a function of choice, the disadvantages dreaming will cause on your wellbeing, effort and reality, the best predictor of our child's emotional well-being is whether they knew their family history, the importance of sleep and self-compassion, and many more.  The author also gives us so many practical tools for us to work out the determinant factors for succcess, on our own unique way, such as Shawn Anchor's  notwenty second rule', Cal Newport's 'shutdown ritual', how to skillfully and sincerely use our network, figuring out whether we are filtered or unfiltered leader, the importance of setting a parameter in a negotiation, and the findings of Robert Epstein research on how to reduce stress, among many others.  All in all, this book is the most complete analysis for its subject, using unorthodox approach and very amusing wide range of information that makes it very fun to read. What Freakonomics did for economics, Why Do Men Have Nipples? did for medicine, and Moonwalking With Einstein did with memory, Barking Up the Wrong Tree does it brilliantly with exploring the keys for success in the real world. I could not recommend it more."

Thou probably will get bored after reading few pages of book. Those who are looking for something that really moves them, sorry to say but this is not the book."
B01KT104RI067,B01KT104RI,Eric Barker,Barking Up the Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong,bm,2017,5.0,9,"WOW!  I have read many self-help books (and clearly this author has too), but only halfway into the book it had safely earned a spot in my Top 10! I tend to be very skeptical of books with lots of hype around them (having recently been disappointed with Brene Brown's ""Braving the Wilderness""), but no...this one deserves the hype!  While I can not say I was personally surprised by a lot the advice he provided (again, I have been around it for years), I can definitely say a lot of wisdom which took me years of trial-and-error to find is in this book. So if you are new to self-help, save yourself the search and heed the advice in here!  There's also one other strength this book has that a lot of others do not: It's fun to read! I am not kidding, the author uses some of the most creative analogies I have heard to illustrate his points. When are you ever going to read a book that uses a colonoscopy to illustrate the way you end your day affects how you remember it?!  My only issue with the book is one most people probably will not care about, but the science-minded individual in me does. The author cites many studies in the book, and while I am grateful he does (better more than less!) I do wish he had referenced them more specifically. My concern is on more than one occasion he might have stretched his claims further than the studies merited. To be fair, A LOT of Pop Psychology books do this, so this is just a minor quibble.  But I digress. This book takes some of the best wisdom you will find in self-help, makes it immensely entertaining, and does not sacrifice its quality to do so. I have no issues recommending this book to even the most casual reader.  The hype is warranted!"

It is refreshing to read that success is not just about following a defined set of things, or that 'everyone' can be a success if they put their mind to it.  Instead, Eric demonstrates that so much of the secret to success is 'it depends' - it depends on what you were born with, what environment you grew up in, how well you know yourself, what the world and local situation looks like at different points in your life journey and so many other variables.  Not to mention it depends on how you define success."
B06XFJ2JGR069,B06XFJ2JGR,Donald Miller,Building a StoryBrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen,bm,2017,5.0,260,"I’ve been a professional writer and copywriter for 50 years now. I’ve written fiction and nonfiction books, articles, blog posts, and a boatload of marketing material. I’ve used the hero’s journey model for more than two decades. So, when I tell you that Building A Story Brand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen by Donald Miller is a book that taught me a lot, that should carry some weight.  I picked it up because a good and trusted friend told me that he thought I’d like it and learn something. At first glance, I thought it was another one of those books about the magic of the hero’s journey. Even so, I dug into it, because my friend is almost always right when he recommends a book. He sure was right this time.  Lots of people have written about how to use the hero’s journey in both storytelling and in marketing copy. This book is about writing marketing copy, especially web copy. Donald Miller does four important things that make this book unique and helpful.  He points out that you shouldn’t be the hero of the story. Many writers do that, but the customer should be the hero. OK, then, what about the company or the brand? That should be the guide. Think Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars or Haymitch from Hunger Games.  Miller also notes that if there’s no danger, there’s no story that matters. Most other writers don’t mention the danger or underplay it. But the reason we call it the” hero’s journey” is that the hero makes it through the forest when lots of other people don’t. Adding that bit on what will happen if the hero fails in his quest will make your marketing copy and your stories stronger.  If you’re used to jargon-filled marketing books, rejoice! This isn’t one of them. Miller writes good, clean prose and his experience as a screenwriter shows up in many of his clear explanations.  That’s enough right there to make this book worth buying. But Miller also lays out a process for you to use when you sit down to create your own copy. He tells you, step by step, how to execute copy that brings each one into play.  In A Nutshell  If you’re an experienced writer or copy writer, you should read Building A Story Brand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen by Donald Miller because it will give you some fresh ideas and insights. If you’re like me, you will already know a lot of what’s here, but you’ll benefit from the clear explanations and the practical how-tos.  If you’re not a pro, this is a great book for you to help you either write your own copy for your website or marketing material or evaluate the copy that other people do for you."

I have tabs (7 of them) to go back to each step to re-visit details. This is a fantastic explanation of Donald Miller's story framework for use in business. Not just marketing, not just web-sites. But you can apply these priniciples to your blogs, tweets, internal presentations, business cases...mainly because it works, everyone universally knows how to consume stories and they will pay attention if you do it right. Mr. Miller makes it easy. (PS - subscribe to his podcast, it is fantastic)"

The book is a quite  long winded and circular, explaining the same basic concepts over and over. In many chapters the author does not seem to provide much concrete, information on how to practically build your own brand script but rather provides one or two tips and then vaguely alludes to how it might be done and describes how one of his consultants could give you more information to help you clarify this further. I was a bit irritated that he keeps explaining how they help people in their courses and through consultation with their 'story brand consultants.' It's like the whole book is an advertisement for their workshop and consultancy services that is paid for by the consumer. It's kind ironic - the book is basically a brandscript for the author's products..."

B077XCPTLT074,B077XCPTLT,Robin Sharma,The 5AM Club: Own Your Morning. Elevate Your Life.,bm,2018,4.0,57,"First of all, The 5am Club is written like a fictional story, and that threw me off a little when I started reading it. The fictional story got a little over the top silly at times, but it kept things interesting, I guess.  Basically, we start with a seminar that’s happening and then follow two main characters as they go on a life-changing trip learning from a billionaire and the teachings of “the Spellbinder.” Again, Sharma keeps things interesting!  The basic idea of the book is that you’ve got to get up at 5am and start your day off right. Doing this will change your life. He goes into what to do with that time in the morning and then how to kind of focus your day.  I found it inspiring. When I started reading it I was already in the habit of getting up around 5am and doing an hour-long workout program. Since the program is for 80 days, and I don’t have an extra 40 minutes after my workout to do the other two pieces (besides exercise) that he says to do in the morning, I can’t quite start doing what he recommends, but I’m doing my own version of it. I was so inspired by this idea that I am now reading The Miracle Morning as my follow up.  I am NOT a morning person as some people have asked me when I mentioned reading this book. I love my sleep and I hate waking up early. However, as a busy mom with a full-time job and lots going on in my life, I do see (and have experienced) the benefits of getting up early and taking time for yourself in the morning. I am starting to implement some of the things he teaches and hope to continue this practice through the year to see where it takes me!  I didn’t love the style of the book, but I did love the message and recommend this book for anyone interested in personal development."

B07BJLX414076,B07BJLX414,Robert Greene,The Laws of Human Nature,bm,2018,5.0,218,first day - Huh I guess everybody craves attention second day - Oh my god I have been repressing my essentially anger nature for years.  This book rapidly alerted me to the parts of myself that I have been trying to hide from myself for years. In addition to that this book will give you a bunch of information on how to understand and interact with other people.
B07BJLX414077,B07BJLX414,Robert Greene,The Laws of Human Nature,bm,2018,3.0,172,This book is written in the reverse of his past works. Instead of getting historical examples and then interpretation you get long literal explanations of these various laws of human nature followed by a historical example.  The change in format is not for the better nor is the execution. The real problem is that Greene goes on too long in his explanations of each law. It becomes boring at times. The discussion on narcissists borders on obsession. This book is closer to Mastery than it is his other works.  There's still much to like of course. I think his explanations of the laws are correct and useful. Just too much. The historical examples are excellent of course but there are too few of them.  If you are a Greene fan I think you will see this one is different and just not up to the excellence of past works. Still enjoyable and worth the purchase. Just not overwhelmingly great.
B07BJLX414078,B07BJLX414,Robert Greene,The Laws of Human Nature,bm,2018,1.0,131,"Note: This is my personal review which might be skewed by my study of Philosophy, Psychology and all of Robert's previous works, as well as my unconscious biases. Therefore, please take it with a grain of salt.  I have been waiting for this book for around 5 years and after reading it cover to cover I am largely underwhelmed by its contents, I have many points to voice but I want to be concise so I will highlight the most important ones in three different bits.  The Book. 1) My main issue with this is book is its self-help nature. Unlike previous works which served as a dispassionate look into the dynamics of people, power, seduction, or war; this book feels like the oh so prevalent genre of self-help, telling you how you should live your life to attain ""greatness"" at every step. For instance, I quote: ""You feel the need to be on top of all the details and global trends so you can control things better, but you are drowning in information. It is hard to see the proverbial forest for the trees. This is a sure sign that you have lost a sense of your priorities"" 2) It takes such a long time to get to the point and most of the chapters are convoluted, they repeat themselves and tend to be contradictory at times. 3) The selection of stories are less precise in illuminating a point, sometimes it looks more like conjecture rather than an illustration of the ""Law""  The Message. _ Most of the laws have been either illustrated before or they are plain common sense. For instance, it takes a whole chapter to understand that people tend to be grandiose but that's good if we can channel it. _ The use of scientifically validated knowledge is unsound. For instance Greene is fond of ideas such as ""Multiple Intelligences"" ""Emotional Intelligence"" or The ""10000 hour rule"". These so-called theories rest on slim evidence at best and are downright misleading at worst. _ Greene overlooks much of the current literature in Psychology and prefers to revert back to the ideas of arcane psychologists like Carl Jung or Sigmund Freud (The very people that the term Pseudo-Science was originally used against) *On that note, he has a persistent fixation with topics like ""the ego"" and Freudian developmental phases in childhood. I tried to shrug it off at first but that’s simply impossible to overlook because the system is such a farcical approach to psychology, or as Psychological Science put it: “There is literally nothing to be said, scientifically or therapeutically, to the advantage of the entire Freudian system or any of its component dogmas.”  The Author. 1) With this book Greene seems to depart from his dispassionate nature, which like Machiavelli's was great for truly getting to the core of human interactions. Now he takes a moralistic approach arguing things like empathy and caring for others are the highest expression of human nature. Nothing wrong with being a good person, but as this book purports to be an objective evaluation of the nature of people it should abstain from any judgmental tendencies on it, or at the very least not state these judgements as ""Laws"". 2) The message is tainted with political undertones, e.g. stating that we live in a disoriented era where ""demagogues and tyrants"" take advantage of us and our tribal tendencies. (These undertones are made explicitly in the pre-release bonuses which take a very leftist approach, but I want to leave that aside because that's not part of the book itself) I am an apolitical person so I could not care less one way or another, but it's very off-putting to find this kind of rhetoric in supposedly objective books.  All in all this is probably a good book for you if: 1) You have zero knowledge of psychology and/or have minimal experience dealing with people. 2) Or You Have a desire for Self-Help advice that can guide your life decisions (if that's your case).  Otherwise please save yourself some time (around 20 hours) and pursue some more meaningful sources on the matter."
B07BJLX414079,B07BJLX414,Robert Greene,The Laws of Human Nature,bm,2018,4.0,81,"So much of discovery is a search for patterns. What links to what? Which variables are related? But patterns aren’t always signs of connection or influence. They can be causal or merely coincidental. And they are seldom universal.  Which is exactly why such a high percentage of scientific discovery turns out to be incorrect, or at least not complete. There is a pattern, but it’s not THE pattern – or at least not the only pattern. And, of course, patterns tend to change over time for a nearly infinite number of reasons.  And that’s the way I felt about the “laws” articulated in this book. I just never got the impression that they were a complete or universal explanation. I could see the pattern. It wasn’t just pulled out of thin air. But it struck me as presumptuous to assume that the “law” was in any way complete or permanent. It might be complete some of the time in some instances. But is it really the final answer that being called a “law of human nature” clearly suggests.  The problem is that laws require generalizations in order to be articulated and applied. And that might work reasonably well in defining traffic laws. Human nature, however, is far more complex and variable. Saying, therefore, that “Introverts are more sensitive and easily exhausted by too much outward activity,” or that, “To the extrovert, the introvert has no fun, is stubborn, even antisocial,” strikes me as applying two-dimensional generalizations to issues and traits that are far more complex than they can accommodate. Isn’t that, after all, part of the explanation for the rancor we currently see in our politics?  I really wanted to like this book. Who doesn’t want to know the laws of nature? Particularly now. To the point that throughout the book I went back to the marketing materials to see what I was missing. And in the “About the Author” section it describes the author as a “renowned expert on power strategies.” And that makes sense to me. And if power strategies is what you’re looking for, and you can buy into the advice - “Take notice of people who praise or flatter you without their eyes lighting up,” as opposed to recognizing they may have just stepped off the red eye, then you will probably like this book very much.  My interests, on the other hand, tend more to philosophy than psychology and I do tend to believe that the Daoists make a very good point – reality is just too nuanced and complicated for our human brains to understand at the level we would need to lay out the laws of human nature.  But if the subject sounds interesting to you, it sounds feasible that one book and one author can lay it all out, or you just like this author, please don’t let me discourage you. (I will admit that I have not read any of the author’s other works.)  He’s obviously accomplished. And if you enjoy the history of psychology you’ll find a lot of gems here. For me, however, the author’s theories are just a little too assertive and built on dangerous generalizations to live by 24/7.  But I’m not much on “power strategies,” either, so take that advice for what it is."
B07BJLX414080,B07BJLX414,Robert Greene,The Laws of Human Nature,bm,2018,5.0,24,It’s a didactic manual for a better self and a better society.

From the start the book caught my interest, I found myself reading everyday and actually enjoying it, again I do not like to or do not have the habit of reading books so for me it is a big deal.  I finished the book and learned a lot from it. I say it is the best cheap investment because I bought it for less than $10.00 dollars and what I learned from the book is worth much more. Looking forward to reading the next books in his series and perhaps exploring other authors that can expand my financial literacy as well.  I recommend this book for anyone who has no idea on how or where to start getting some financial education and inspiration. It is a short and easy to understand book and maybe like it did with me, it will be a gateway to get you to finally do something about investing in your knowledge for financial independence."

Brene Brown excels once again and goes further with her research and writing to describe behaviors and emotions that we have all felt.  More importantly, she gives us constructive actions we can take to live and work more effectively and wholeheartedly.  Page 70 sums up the journey her book will take you on should you chose to go.  It reads, ""Leaders must either invest a reasonable amount of time attending to fears and feelings, or squander an unreasonable amount of time trying to manage ineffective and unproductive behavior.""  Pages 76 and 77 give you sixteen specific examples of Armored Leadership and Daring Leadership.  You will recognize them immediately.  And you will be able to call out the behaviors that are holding you back or propelling you forward.  On subsequent pages she unpacks the examples so that we can put the words to work for ourselves and our colleagues."

In her brief bio, it states that Brene Brown has  ""spent past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame and empathy.""  Those are not the typical descriptions of bestselling business characteristics. In fact, this book could really be sub-titled,""How to be a better human being and apply your new  amuscles' to the business of leadership."" What's fascinating is that the author calls herself a ""research professor"" with a social work doctorate, and her research has been extensive and varied, from military leaders to teachers. In this regard she has adopted the data-based techniques of Jim Collins, whose ""Good to Great"" has been the gold standard for many years. But her message is different in that it does not recommend ""engineering"" innovation, but rather relying on ""rumbling with vulnerability,"" ""living into one's values,"" and having the courage to make decisions even where the outcome may be uncomfortable and possibly a failure. Her idea that uncertainty can lead to the positive result of ""unpredictable and uncontrollable connections"" is applicable to parents and students and care-givers and workers of all stripes as well as c-suite leaders. Anyone who wants to take control of his or her life and understand the role of humility in human relationships will want to read this book. As she points out, it takes about the same length of time to read as a flight from Los Angeles to New York ""with a small delay."" Very much worth the time."

Whole Hearts.,bm,2018,5.0,57,"If you are a leader or aspire to be one, this book will speak to you on a very emotional level, particularly her chapter on “Armored Leadership.” As I read the sixteen examples of armored leadership and the contrasting daring leadership actions, I found myself evaluating my own experiences as a leader.  There were points where I could say, “Yes, I nailed that one!” but too many times where my response was, “Yeah, I failed to realize what I was doing and fell right into the trap.”  Her chapter on “Living into Your Values,” validates my conviction that values are at the very center of what we do as leaders.  If we do not identify and act on our values, we will fail.  Brown writes, “Daring leaders who live into their values are never silent about the hard things.”  Living into our values means more than articulating our values; it means that we practice them. She explains that individuals do not have two sets of values--one personal and one professional.  We have only one set of values that we are called to practice in all areas of our lives.  This is a great book.  Whatever your position is, whatever your responsibilities, please read this book and put its lessons into practice."

The writing was wonderful: by turns funny and touching, as was the author’s clear concern for the individuals who assist his under-cover endeavors.

However, at the very end of the book, not the chapter, we’re advised that the store in question has completely corrected that situation.  One store, one situation, fixed.

Mostly, it's an impressionistic, and densely worded, take on long-haul trucking, product placement (one example) and shrimp production.  Lots of the material, especially the material on shrimp and labor exploitation, has been done before, as anyone who reads the newspaper knows.  The first chapter is about the guy who founded Trader Joe's, so there's material on one supermarket chain, but it's not very interesting, except as pop business philosophy.  It's a quick read, but the jokes are bad, and the author is fond of long, meandering footnotes, that are rendered in very small print.  Buyer beware."
B083RZFYZC094,B083RZFYZC,Benjamin Lorr,The Secret Life of Groceries: The Dark Miracle of the American Supermarket,bm,2020,4.0,10,"This is a book with horrific information about the awful unfairness of workers’ conditions and compensation; the health risks of food produced that isn’t fit for human consumption but promoted as though it were; and, the lack of integrity by food producers and the willful blindness toward them by the grocery colossus. It is a modern day version of Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle” which did so much to protect the American people by the passage of laws assuring the safety of our food supply."
B083RZFYZC095,B083RZFYZC,Benjamin Lorr,The Secret Life of Groceries: The Dark Miracle of the American Supermarket,bm,2020,2.0,8,"This book could have been so much better - and it should have been much longer. The Kindle version ends up being 60 percent book (and much of that is seemingly unending thumbsucking and philosophizing) and 40 percent footnotes. It is a true shock when you end up with 40 percent of a book remaining and -- it's not really remaining.  The author spends some worthy time looking into the challenge of creating and marketing a new grocery product, the rigors of long-distance trucking and - at much too much length - shrimp farming in Thailand. This guy took a couple of tax-deductible work trips to Southeast Asia and bled them for all they are worth - plus some.  He offers a bit of insight into the creation and development of Trader Joe's and Whole Foods - and the icky situation at one (1) Whole Foods fish counter.  So, there is some interesting information here, but not nearly enough of it. And he spends WAY too much time typing random thoughts that make little sense.  One of many examples: ""Retail is one of the oldest, most important forms of human connection, once circle outside family, and just as important in current society to meeting our vital needs. Its uniquely material focus makes it a bridge between these two forms of self-expression: between the possessions we flaunt and how her treat the people who make them. [OK, this makes a bit of sense and it's best to stop here, but.....no.] Right now the methods of bringing integrity to to this connection - the signs and seals of certification - make no corresponding effort so span this divide. [What?] They promise us [no, they do not] that moments of  individual action can create a type of change that in reality only institutional forces like labor laws, union, and trade deals can being to approach. They allow us to purchase our ideals [What?] from others without ever having to enact them on our own."" [WHAT?}  That's only one of dozens of examples and not close to the most puzzling.  This book is like a cheap crab cake - very little meat, lots and lots of filler."

It does have some basic money concepts that are valid. However, it has so many offensive micro-aggressions. In his letter to his son, ""Not all poor people are lazy."" Huh? Describing himself as a ""slave"" to his investment banker boss. Have you studied what slavery actually was? The horrors inflicted on people. Also, how about mentioning how slavery contributed to the wealth of early white male slaveholders and is the foundation of the US economy? Finally, nearly all of his references and stories are about white men (the one exception Chris Rock briefly mentioned). When a voice is so one-sided, I begin to distrust the thinking. I have to reformulate in my head how all of it applies to me. At a certain point I had to wonder--when was this book written? When I read the publication date, not 1950 but September 2020, I stopped reading. Shamefully out of touch.  I am so sorry I contributed to his wealth by buying this book--disgraceful."

It is only good for beginners  Correct on the first part. There is nothing new here. Just as philosophy has existed for thousands of years, yet few people tend to get out of their way to find a few good books, read them and get something out of them.  The book has ideas that are not new, but are brought up and packaged in a convenient way for you to read them, analyze them and preach them. Some of the ideas, in the book (as a beginner), were stuff I have never heard of (despite listening to a lot of flashy investing podcasts and ""know-it-all gurus"") and I have had many ""aha"" moments through reading the book. I am only in the middle of the book, right now, writing this.  In the second part of the statement, about the target audience, I do believe nobody knows everything about money, psychology nor investing.

The author touches more upon psychology of finance (obvious from the title I know) rather than specific investing strategies. This is important as this book is for people to understand how the financial world works rather than how to get rich/earn loads of money. Very crisply written with tons of real life examples, this book is definitely in the league of rich dad poor dad. The penultimate chapter summarizes all the concepts nicely and ties in all the wisdom the author wanted to share. If I had to summarize this book in a couple of sentences I would say, it emphasizes the importance of living below one’s means, encourages people to save just for the sake of it and finally reminds us that financial freedom is the ultimate goal one should strive towards rather than just earn to impress.

Most people are disconnected from reality, as in, what is taking place around the world.  I personally think most of the people in the West are disconnected in terms of where the world is heading and I believe this book does a great job to educate these souls about history and what they can expect in future.  I will sum up my takeaway in few lines so you can save yourself time and effort...  There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen...  As Howard Marks recently said:  ""I doubt most people could actually explain what a trillion is (that is, they likely have no idea that it’s a thousand billion, or a million million). And the scale of a trillion is almost incomprehensible. I was struck 30-40 years ago to learn that whereas a million dollars is $10 a second for 28 hours, a billion dollars is $10 a second for 38 months. Now let’s think about a trillion: $10 a second for more than 3,000 years. As I said, almost incomprehensible.""  With trillions printed, you should be ready for a ride of a lifetime.

Left, right, or centrist - it doesn’t matter… in fact, if you treat the material seriously, it will help you bridge the political divides that today’s media are creating, and populist politicians are exploiting. This is long-term thinking, but not ivory tower… or dreamer; it does a better job of explaining money than any MBA finance class.  As someone who has dedicated his life to serving - and thinking about - cooperative businesses, especially in the financial sector; I found this material both inspirational and alarming.

B0881Y73YG104,B0881Y73YG,Ray Dalio,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail,bm,2021,5.0,19,"Great book. Dalio does a remarkable job seeing the bigger picture and providing confidence through historical events/ever repeating cycles that you can predict at a high level what is coming next for a given country or the world and plan accordingly. The corkscrew of evolution analogy is a perfect one, where the human race has up and down cycles but always trends up longer term thanks to technological innovation.  My one criticism is he speaks out of both sides of his mouth in one instance, presumably because he doesn’t want to upset any high ranking politicians or leaders he may be friends with, which I found to be disappointing.  On the one hand, he notes at the start of the book that no two democracies have waged war with each other, wars have only been fought between dictators/police states and democracies or just dictators/police states.  Then later on when discussing China, he all but excuses and rationalizes their increasingly authoritarian state, as seen by Xi crowning himself leader until death and abolishing the precedent of 2 5 year term limits as of 2018. He blesses the Chinese approach of a few rulers knowing what’s best for all, as if those rulers are acting in the broader interest of Chinese people, and that’s an acceptable alternative to democratic rule. He cites the recent video game ban as having merit or at least being understandable, suggesting that he thinks the ends can justify the means. All the while there’s no mention of the atrocities of Mao under this authoritarian type of rule, no mention of the Muslim genocide going on now, the suppression of free speech and jailings and beating and murders of those that oppose the current regime, no mention of internet censorship, etc.  To bring the criticism full circle, he doesn’t link his first point on wars and authoritarians always being involved in them, with the fact that China is an authoritarian state and therefore it’s rise threatens the free world and human progress. Ironically, he does correctly acknowledge China’s opening up to market and establishment of capitalist principles for rocketing them toward the US in terms of power, while refuses to critique the political system despite its history of failings, violence and pain. Russia invading Ukraine couldn’t drive this point (ie the civil or political system being as important as the economic system to the long term success of a country and world peace) home any harder."
B0881Y73YG105,B0881Y73YG,Ray Dalio,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail,bm,2021,1.0,17,"Why are people slobbering all over this propaganda? Dalio might’ve once been an ethical man, but he isn’t now.  Have you seen his interviews, pushing this tripe? When pressed about Xi’s tyranny, he says China is like a ""strict parent."" Hmmm... Let's ask the 1 million Uyghurs in concentration camps how they feel about dad, shall we? Or we could ask Jack Ma. Or Peng Shuai. Or the people of Hong Kong. Or Tibet. Or the private tutoring companies who lost $120 billion dollars overnight in August 2021 because Xi had a temper tantrum when an executive criticized China's education system. The list is long and ugly.  One thing is certain, China spreads oppression equally.  Dalio argues for making money in a new empire while the empire that nurtured him, gave him freedom and a wide runway to grow his wealth is best left in his rear-view mirror. It's just history, he says. He is, as stated in the subject line, a shoe in for Animal Farm’s propagandist, Squealer. The analogy fits. He's putting lipstick on a pig.  The country is not as stable as they'd like you to believe. China has inflated their economic numbers (aka lied). They have given bad loans to nations around the world, and those loans are defaulting. They have built high rises that sit empty, freeways no one uses, and the Belt and Road Initiative has gone wildly over budget. Evergrande, it turns out, is just one floor in their house of cards.  Now you see why Dalio is trying to convince Americans to hand over their wealth to Bridgewater China. Xi wants your money.  I predict the dragon will rise, but it will never be *the* world leader, a position China desperately wants. Dalio and his Bridgewater China minions will make money for a time---until Xi decides he wants it. Good luck getting it back.  Dalio is on the business talk-show circuit, pushing his book and singing the decline of America. He keeps telling us America’s political parties won’t accept the outcome of the 2024 elections, while praising China’s “common prosperity” (Xi’s latest push to steal people’s money). Dalio also preaches about closing the wealth gap. A worthy principle, but in China’s case that means billionaires disappear for a few months. They magically resurface, announcing they’ll give away billions of dollars. In Dalio’s case, closing the wealth gap is hot air. He’s keeping his billions. Funny how that goes.  Investor beware. Dalio is spouting Communist China talking points. Like Putin, he is licking China’s boot. Unfortunately, the boot he licks today will stomp on him tomorrow.  Because this book is self-serving propaganda, it gets 1 star. Zero would be better."
B08FGV64B1106,B08FGV64B1,Oliver Burkeman,Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals,bm,2021,5.0,177,"Thanks to Farrar, Straus and Giroux and NetGalley for an advance copy of this book. I loved it so much I have bought a copy, and plan to give more as gifts!  I’ve been a fan of Burkeman’s since his first book, The Antidote, which is a long-time favorite of mine. I loved the way Burkeman reviewed positive psychology through a skeptical lens, and somehow came out with perhaps the most useful, meaningful self-help book I’ve read yet. (I genuinely still think about that book, almost a decade later). When I learned that he had written a book about productivity, I could not wait to read it, and was so delighted to receive an early copy.  Well, it’s simply the best nonfiction book I’ve read in years. It’s provocative, entertaining, and genuinely useful. The ideas in this book will improve your life, and even if you read a fair amount of self-help and productivity, I doubt you’ve heard them before.  There are a lot of mind-expanding insights here, but the key one is that to be a productivity nerd is to feel existential anxiety. The premise of the productivity genre is that if we can just get our lives ever-more optimized, we need never face the reality that we can’t, in fact, do everything that we care about. Burkeman says we have to start by admitting defeat: our time is limited, and the future we imagine when we’ve become our most self-actualized, accomplished selves, with inboxes empty and goals achieved, is a fun-house mirror that keeps us separate from our real lives.  I don’t want to spoil too much of this book in advance, because it’s an absolute joy to read: Burkeman’s writing crackles, he has such big and original ideas, he illustrates those ideas with lively and unfamiliar examples (did you know that the Soviets experimented for decades with their own work week?! Do you know why it failed??), and he’s just so damned humane. He balances his counterintuitive ideas with practical, actionable advice, which, I can say with confidence, have already improved my productivity and mental health way more than a pomodoro timer ever did.  (I also highly recommend Burkeman’s twice-a-month newsletter, the Imperfectionist, which you can find on his website!)"
B08H177WQP107,B08H177WQP,Adam Grant,Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know,bm,2021,5.0,471,"The three hardest things to say in English are ""I was wrong"", ""I am sorry"", and ""Worcestershire sauce."" Adam Grant can definitely help you with the first two. In a world changing at unprecedented speed, there's a new must-need skill on the block: ""Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.""  If you think rethinking is hard, you think rightly. Our inner Preacher, Prosecutor and Politician stand ready to trip us up: ""The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views.""  So what should we do instead? This book helps you find your inner Scientist — infinitely curious, moderately confident, perennially skeptical. Then ""you define your identity in terms of values, not opinions"", and actively ""seek out information that goes against your views.""  With expert storytelling and a breezy yet earnest tone, Adam guides you through the perils and rewards of rethinking at the individual, interpersonal, and collective level. In the process, you will meet a cast of fascinating folks who practice expert-level rethinking. There's Daryl Davis, the Black musician with the hobby of converting KKK members into friends. There's the vaccine whisperer who gets legions of anti-vax parents to vaccinate their kids, and Erin McCarthy who has her students re-write old history textbooks. And the other stories I am not even mentioning lest I spoil your fun in reading Adam's deft plot twists and big reveals.  I particularly appreciate the plenitude of wisdom in this book, much of it counterintuitive. For example, assembling a ""challenge network"" of our most thoughtful critics (instead of a support network of yes-men) seems like a useful exercise against overconfidence. And it's heartening that a little bit of impostor syndrome actually renders us more credible. And now that Adam has highlighted the efficacy of motivational interviewing, I will use it much more in my coaching & behavioral change practice.  In addition to being supremely well-structured and instructive, ""Think Again"" is delightfully quirky. I read 160-180 nonfiction books a year, and it's safe to say I have not read anything like this. There are a ton of cartoons, real and faux diagrams, and funny-yet-true flowcharts to illustrate points and elicit chuckles. Adam often inserts italicized musings and asides smack in the middle of a paragraph. The epilogue, which is kind of bonkers, embodies rethinking in physical form. And -- mayonnaise.  This is an utterly original book on a topic that not only bears directly upon our success, but also our long-term happiness: ""It takes humility to reconsider our past commitments, doubt to question our present decisions, and curiosity to reimagine our future plans. What we discover along the way can free us from the shackles of our familiar surroundings and our former selves. Rethinking liberates us to do more than update our knowledge and opinions—it’s a tool for leading a more fulfilling life."" That sounds pretty important to me, so I will be re-reading rethinking regularly.

It will guide marketers and copywriters to understand the reasoning for some of the things that have been around forever while also helping clarify the boundaries for healthy sales and persuasion vs unethical persuasion.

B0947VHKC2111,B0947VHKC2,Ryan Holiday,Courage Is Calling: Fortune Favors the Brave (The Stoic Virtues Series),bm,2021,3.0,177,"Readers of Holiday's previous books will instantly recognize the narrative style - hyper-caffeinated, short chapters that seem to keep repeating the same points,  sprinkled with a curated set of quotes from various Stoic/eastern philosophy sources - all served with a generous tone of cheerleading.  If you are a fan of that style, this book will not disappoint - can be a good companion of his book on obstacles.  For those who will not enjoy pages and pages of the same tone, this will be a test of patience.  There are gems of observations scattered in a few chapters.  A few thought frames that can be used to start facing a ""fear"" are mentioned, but not necessarily in a easy-to-categorize and absorb manner. The book itself is organized into three parts - Fear, Courage and Heroism.  Roughly, the emphasis of each segment is (at least how I felt useful to go through the book) - why we are fearful or lack courage,  how to create the first moves/momentum to build courage, and what can sustain and build.  Instead of trying to formulate a somewhat linear narrative of causes-diagnosis-treatments-management,  the reader is left to own devices to develop a thought framework of one's own.  Perhaps, the most original and useful section of the book is the discussion of his own experience at American Apparel (it is all the way at the end at ""Afterword"").  The self-appraisals and observations based on his experience there captures his views on courage very well - this chapter should have been the introduction, not the Afterword.  That could potentially have set up the book much better.  Having read all his books and continue to enjoy his weekly reading lists, the last two books (this one and Life of Stoics) have been underwhelming.  I wish he expands on his American Apparel experience and use that as a foil to narrate almost all the themes from his books on ego, obstacles, and courage.  Even with some poetic licenses, that will be a good book.  This one, will engage and entertain you for a bit, but the constant haranguing of finding the courage gives the book the tone of a cliched motivation speaker."
B0947VHKC2112,B0947VHKC2,Ryan Holiday,Courage Is Calling: Fortune Favors the Brave (The Stoic Virtues Series),bm,2021,1.0,78,"Simple message “You need more courage” “you need to work really hard”…. the Book repeats the same cliches in different ways throughout . But It doesn’t give any concrete new information or useful knowledge. The entire point of the book is the same as Nike motto “just do it!”… seriously that’s it. It’s repetitive, has overly excited, hyper pumped stories that have no real message except “you need to be brave and do more stuff in your life” but nothing else to it. Maybe It has a few decent history stories about military generals but there is no real take away value in this book other than “Be brave”, have courage like General Mattis or “be more like general Ulysses Grant” and don’t be afraid to try things …etc. etc. if you want stories  about military generals who succeeded by killing more people and inflicting more carnage than their opponents did, or if you want to hear how other people are so brave and tough, then maybe this book will motivate you. This cliched book feels like it was rushed with simple historical stories to make a quick buck. The author put no real tangible value or take away into this book other than a hyper repetitive message said in articulate ways, but the message is the same; “be brave”, “don’t be afraid, you need to do more stuff, be like so & so, you need more courage!! It’s calling!! …etc…ZZzzzz"

B0947VHKC2114,B0947VHKC2,Ryan Holiday,Courage Is Calling: Fortune Favors the Brave (The Stoic Virtues Series),bm,2021,1.0,12,"I recently heard Ryan Holiday pontificating his book on a podcast. I was struck by his put downs of others who either aren’t courageous or don’t know what it is. Doesn’t take much courage to think we know others.  The library book came into my queue, and I decided to give it a try. After a few pages I quit.  He says, “When you do the thing others cannot or will not do. When you do the thing that people think you shouldn’t or can’t do. Otherwise it’s not courage.”  These words jibe with his podcast interview. The notion that courage is a competition, that it’s light depends on other thoughts and actions. Courageous people could care less. Whether others can do or not is irrelevant.  Further, “You have to be braving something or someone. Still, courage remains something hard to define. We know it when we see it, but it’s hard to say it. Accordingly, the aim of this book is not definitions. Rarer than a rare gem, courage is something we must hold up to inspect from many angles.”  Not really. Courage is easy to define. And no, it isn’t rare at all. Perhaps Ryan Holiday should consider hanging out with different people, or causes. Courage abounds everywhere."

This book does not require the reader to dedicate hours of contemplation to each chapter or page. I read most of this book in waiting rooms or on breaks at work. It's very digestible like that. Ryan Holiday really did an excellent job pacing the book and breaking up its chapters.  It's not some deep treatise on the philosophical notions of courage. It's an evidence-based, historical approach to the Stoic virtue of courage. Courage is not the absence of fear -- it's moving forward in spite of your fear, or because of it.  Others have been in worse situations than you. Others have done this task before. ""What one man can do another can do"" is a mantra from one of my favorite movies. You can have courage. You can do the right thing.  Also, I really enjoyed the last chapter. Maybe I have missed it, but I have never heard Holiday go into depth about his life before Daily Stoic. I knew he was a marketing executive at American Apparel, but that was it. I knew there'd been some scandal with the CEO. But that was all I knew and all I cared to know. But Holiday opens up and writes about what happened, his role, and his regrets. He explains where he failed to have courage, and when he began to have it. It was a really honest look back, and one that I truly appreciated because we all have been there -- maybe not at a major company, but certainly all of us have been moral cowards at various points in our lives.  While I have always appreciated Holiday's efforts at bringing Stoicism to modern life, that last chapter really made me love and respect him. It's what led me to write this review, in fact."

The author is not wrong though, I’ve already cleaned my whole house and finally had the motivation to finish my Christmas shopping that I previously couldn’t be bothered to care about. I also appreciated the distinction between things that are exciting and things that are fulfilling. Lately I’ve indulging in a lot of exciting things and I haven’t had the motivation to do the less stimulating but much more fulfilling art projects that I used to enjoy. And hasn’t life always been a balance between hedonism and asceticism? I suppose I can watch TikTok and read smutty books in the evening when I’ve finished my work. Sigh."

However, right away I was put off by the author's attempts to cite scientific studies to support his ideas. While this is a worthy cause, it made it clear that the author does not understand the difference between correlation and causation and made me audibly grown at several points. For example, in a section that is trying to build a foundation for happiness in the pursuit of helping others as opposed to himself, he speaks about the idea that sex makes us happy. He then talks about how if that's true, sex with more people would make us happier than sex with one person. I would argue that these are two completely different ideas. To ""back up"" his claim, he cites a source that found that people with multiple partners are more unhappy than those with one, and then makes the assumption that this is BECAUSE of the number of partners. It completely misses that this is not a case of cause, but that of correlation. People who have one sexual partner likely differ from those with many is a magnitude of ways, and stating that their unhappiness is due to their sexual choices is just not good science.  I finally stopped reading when he began talking about money, and talked about how the vast majority of people in America do not have a wage issue, but a spending issue. He tries to connect that since the majority of the world survives on less than $5 a day, that Americans are totally fine with whatever their current wage is and implies that an increase to $15 a day in minimum wage is not actually needed. (This was the subtext of this section, not explicitly stated). This is a GROSS dismissal of the greatly differing cost of living in most places in America compared to areas of the world that live on less than $5 a day. At this point I was about 50% of the way through the book, and upon reflecting on whether I'd walked away with anything useful or helpful, my answer was no. I returned the book to the library, and I would NOT recommend it to the vast majority of people."

After cleaning out my 99 year old great aunt's house full of ""stuff"" that meant nothing to me, this book took that perspective and reminded me it's time to do the purging for myself as well as those I will leave behind.

I really enjoyed the stories he included to make the concepts he introduces so relatable to me as a reader.  If you are familiar with the author's other works, you know he's a fan of minimalism and seeks to inspire others ""to pursue their passions while owning fewer possessions."" That sentiment influences this book greatly, particularly in how you live your life, spend your time, contribute to your community, and influence those around you.  If you are new to practicing minimalism, some statements might come across as blunt - ""If you want to live a more meaningful life focused on the things that matter, own less stuff."" I'd encourage you to not get discouraged by that and to keep reading because he also writes, ""it's important to note that owning less is not about owning nothing. It's about owning the right things and the right number of them."" And what he shares about his Grandpa's life and sense of purpose is so powerful and inspiring. He lived a life that mattered and I want to live my life like that too. This book provides you with plenty to think about to help do just that."

It doesn’t need be something big, need be for another person, need be your good for others. But, what are distracting us from this meaningful life ? Our past? this very thing that we are holding while read and write this review? Our strong desire to be successful no matter what? And so much more.

Most of us including me fall short.  If you follow what Dr. Hardy says in this gem, you will get to your goals and outcomes with a whole lot more certainty, faster than you ever thought was possible.  I read this five weeks ago, did everything Dr. Hardy told me to do in the book including the last step in the conclusion, and have never come close to having more gigantic opportunities come into my life because I was acting like my future self (5 years from now - even more energetic, happy, fulfilled, successful, fit) which allowed me to receive those opportunities.

I read them repeatedly because I always get something new.  Or rather, I have changed, and I see something new.  Be Your Future Self Now will be added to this library. It changed how I see myself. I now clearly understand why I get stuck and what to do about it.  It’s a step-by-step manual on how to design the life you crave.  I got crystal clear on three goals I want to achieve over the next three years. And I have a plan on how I will make it happen. Now that I’m clear about what I want to achieve, I will make decisions today as if I’m already that person– three years from now.  However, there is a catch. It requires work. Lots of it. The ideas and concepts are science-based research–not fantasy or “The Secret.”  For example, I want to hit a net worth objective over the next three years. Based on my current ability, this number is not achievable. What would my future self do today to put me on that path? Since reading the book, I have hired a new team of experts, immersing myself in financial education.  If you’re looking for a quick fix or are allergic to work–this is not the book for you.

B09BTV53VD133,B09BTV53VD,Benjamin P. Hardy,Be Your Future Self Now: The Science of Intentional Transformation,bm,2022,3.0,12,"Hardy also produces YouTube vids, and much of the book reads like a transcription of the videos. That's not always a bad thing. Funny, but I think of Jesus when I read his book or listen to a video: I see now how people around Jesus were amazed that Jesus spoke differently, as one with authority. Hardy does not do that. In fact, his writing and talking are generally long dissertations of other people's work and what other people said and how other people do things...all with notes and references.  As an aficionado of self-help, I was excited about this book but there's really nothing new added here that's added to the genre. If you can call it a genre. It's similar stuff uniquely packaged and said differently, but if you have read other big name self-helpers, then you will have heard it all before.  One thing bothers me, and maybe it's the real truth of all self-helpers: other writers say their goal is to help you - the reader - achieve and attain and become something. Hardy is unabashed that his goal is to be a professional writer. When I talk with other newish writers - a woman I know in Britain has just published her second book and we talk about this - they are busting at the seams to write and connect with people. You sense in their voice and in the tone of their writing that this welling up of feelings is genuine. I sense with Hardy that he...wants to be famous. I do not know him and might change my mind if we met...  Okay, two things. I signed onto something and gave him my email address. Now I get two or three emails a week directing me to a breakthrough 90-minute video that I SIMPLY MUST WATCH IF I'M SERIOUS ABOUT MY FUTURE. Maybe, if I were serious about my future, I'd set aside the four or five hours a week to watch this stuff, but, well, the lawn needs mowing and I have my own books to write.  Even so, it's good read that is written conversationally."

In reviewing the reviews of others one person mentioned that this is a book if you have 20 years or more in front of you. I disagree with this. I am 67. I have been extremely depressed because I do not believe that enjoyment in my life should be based on hobbies or whatever else ""old people"" do. I still want more out of my life. I still want to make a difference in the lives of others. This book. Wow. It's like Hardy read my mind. Where there's no hope there's no future and that's how I had begun to feel...hopeless at 67. I had started a YouTube channel...@reikiraven...but had come to a halt, wondering how I could possibly think I am good enough to help others. Now I am looking at my future self, 5 years from now and I have helped a large number of people and it feels great!  The only criticism I have is that the author talks about investing in yourself a LOT throughout the book. I totally understand the investment...it just rings a little hollow when he's pushing a $197 program every time you click on one of his links.  Other than that, the book is highlighted from beginning to end.  I recommend to anyone who has lost hope in their current situation. It does not have everything you need, but it's definitely a great place to begin!"

If only with this book had been written ten years ago! Of course, the note taking tools of ten years ago didn’t lend themselves to this method as well as modern tools do, but I would’ve found a way to make it work. For my entire adult life, I’ve tried and failed to find a system that works for me. A way for me to create what I called a personal knowledgebase that covered all aspects of my life, but what Tiago Forte calls a Second Brain. I had a system I used in the 90s in Microsoft Outlook. I created “contacts” with various notes and information I wanted to be able to easily access, then peppered it with keywords to search on. But as one job led to another and another, I lost that repository. I’ve used folders, notebooks, and even invested in The Paper Tiger, a method that relied on search terms and tags to find information, but everything ultimately left me feeling more frustrated than helped.  Enter Evernote, Notion, and similar apps. I discovered Notion before I discovered this book. I began using it to store information I had once stored in Microsoft OneNote, due do the markdown language capabilities and robust database support. As I learned how to use Notion, I stumbled upon Thomas Frank. He’s not only a Notion guru, but a Second Brain evangelist. I bought Tiago Forte’s book shortly after watching Frank’s first video. But as I read the book, the more I realized that Notion wasn’t really the right tool for me. The ability to create a folder structure and areas the way my brain works, was hindered by the complexity of Notion. That was the opposite of what I needed.  When I finished Forte’s book, I simultaneously stumbled upon a post on Medium about another note-taking app called Nimbus Note. I did the free two week trial, and by the end of the first day, I knew that Nimbus more closely aligns with how I personally took the lessons from Forte’s book and applied them to my life. Since then, I’ve become more organized, more resourceful, and more importantly as an author, more creative! Being able to spend more time brainstorming and less time digging through my notes has added a level of focus I didn’t know I was capable of.  I loved this book so much, I bought a paperback copy for my husband and he’s adopting these techniques as well!"

However, I would expect a book to be citing the original source. In this case, I was able to find the original article in less than 5 minutes, a 30 pages study by Drs Roger E Bohn and James Short from the University of California (How Much Information? 2009 Report on American Consumers).

If you have ever felt like you are drowning in information with no real way to make it anything other than noise, or if you have ever felt like all your creativity is locked behind a wall of ""tasks"" that do nothing more than maintain your rut, please please please pick up this book.  I have been a blogger, note-taker, creative and knowledge worker for years, and I learned more from this book than I did in years on my own.

I was putting things into practice as I was reading them, changing how I did things to incredible effect in each chapter. I have already seen huge impacts, and I am about to read it again for another pass!  In the interest of fairness (and to ensure I do not come across as a drooling sycophant), I will offer some criticism. A fair amount of the word count in the book is Forte continuing to espouse the virtues of Personal Knowledge Management, of ""Building A Second Brain."" He is not wrong, of course, but I did not need convincing - and probably most people reading this book will not need nearly as many examples, anecdotes, and inspiring stories as Forte presents. Each one is individually good, but the actionable content in the book stands on its own merits.  And I truly mean that - the actionable content in the book is so good it's easily going to become my most-recommended book just based on the last few weeks alone. And if nothing else, capturing the content that most resonated with me into more easily-referenced notes was a perfect first exercise for my own Second Brain!  Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended.

B09PB1SB72144,B09PB1SB72,Ryan Holiday,Discipline Is Destiny: The Power of Self-Control (The Stoic Virtues Series),bm,2022,5.0,64,"If you were asked to describe what Stoics look like, how would you describe them?  First and foremost, they are visibly calm and patient, able to wait for the right time and the right moment. They also have self control over their indulgences, and not letting impulses to undermine them. And while they still enjoy all the perks and luxuries in life, they do so within limits and nothing in excess. Everything in moderation, they would say.  They of course still get angry and can even be very passionate, but they will not do anything out of anger. They respond, not react. They are able to not getting victory or criticism get into their head and affect them. They have the patience to not getting triggered by provocations, have the self restrain of avoiding all the quick fix scam or euphoria or gurus.  Stoics understand their own weak points, their triggers whether it is anxiety or aggression or lust, and how to contain them and address them. They also have the self-restraining ability from being trapped by a perfectionist prison, that you need everything to be perfect that it makes you refrain from doing things imperfectly and ended up not doing anything at all.  And instead, they have the strength and ability to finish the job through all the messiness, have intense focus while doing it, have the sense of urgency, but doing so by projecting grace under fire. They are quick, but not in a hurry. Indeed, while courage was defined as the willingness to put your ass on the line, Stoics have the ability to keep this particular ass in line, to go to the right length and no further.  Nevertheless, although they have the strength and endurance to weather any storm, they also have the decisiveness to cut loss, to step back, to throw in the towel when it’s a losing cause. It also means load management, knowing when to take a rest, giving their body enough time for recovery, taking a break, avoiding burnout, or simply to have a restful sleep. Everything is measured.  Moreover, Stoics are responsible with money, able to constrain themselves from splurging or wasting them on things that don’t matter. They also use time efficiently, use words wisely (brevity - not using two words if one word would do, or not using one if none would do), they also have the ability to put boundaries, to say no to all the unimportant things.  Last but not least, they keep their environment clean and minimalist. They keep themselves neat and tidy, dressing appropriately for the occasion and situation, demonstrating that they are in control over their outer appearance as well as their inner, aware of their surroundings, and can present themselves appropriately.  This, in a nutshell, is what discipline looks like. It is virtue no. 2 out of 4 on the four Stoic virtues of courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. And it is arguably the most visible trait of a practicing Stoic.  In another unmissable Ryan Holiday signature style of writing, this book illustrates the traits mentioned above through so many stories from history and its many prominent figures. It shows that discipline is the key feature of all successful people, and more importantly it shows how these great men and women implement them despite their shortcomings, unfriendly environment, or upbringing.  Holiday reflects these lessons from the incredible habits of Lou Gehrig, the resilience of Theodore Roosevelt, the Stoic nature of George Washington, the calm and dignified Queen Elizabeth II, the restraint of Dwight Eisenhower, the grounded nature of Angela Merkel, the practicality of John Wooden, the 100% effort of Jimmy Carter,  the importance of load management from Harry Belafonte and Martin Luther King Jr., to cautionary tales from King George IV and Babe Ruth, and lessons from many others such as Martha Graham, Joyce Carol Oates, Booker T. Washington, Floyd Patterson, and as usual the Stoic greats like Cato, Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.  Now, of course discipline is not easy. But as Holiday remarks, “the good news is that because it’s hard, most people don’t do it. They don’t show up. They can’t even do one tiny thing a day. So yes, you’re alone, out there on the track in the rain. You’re the only one responding on Christmas. But having the lead is, by definition, a little lonely. This is also why it’s quiet in the morning. You have the opportunities all to yourself.”  And this is why discipline can be an edge. Discipline is the reason we get up and do our thing every single day, on time. It is what keeps us going even during hardship. It is what prevents us from risk and catastrophe. What helps us maintain our habit, our flow, even our savings. Discipline keeps us in check to do the right things, even if we don’t like it. It paved the road to the good life, it keeps us healthy and happy. Discipline is the key ingredient to shape our destiny."
B09RX5F238145,B09RX5F238,Chris Miller,Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,bm,2022,5.0,53,"Apple just released its latest cell phone, powered by an A16 chip with 16 billion tiny transistors carved into its silicon in Taiwan using equipment made in the Netherlands. Back in 1961, Fairchild Semiconductor's cutting-edge chip had four transistors. The path between (Moore's Law) is paved with the contributions of manufacturing experts, supply chain specialists, marketing managers, electrical engineers, physicists and bold corporate leaders around the world. Automobiles now often include a thousand dollars worth of chips.  America's production of steel, aluminum etc., along with subsequent products, largely determined WWII's outcome. The Gulf War and now Ukrainian War shows that chips identifying targets and maneuvering themselves have become today's key to victory, not volume of tanks etc.  'Chip Wars' takes readers first through Shockley's invention of the transistor, then Noyce/Kilby creating integrated circuits. Apollo 11 eventually landed and returned men to/from the moon with a computer weighing 70 lbs - a thousand times less than its ENIAC tube-filled predecessor. Prior to that even, Jay Lathrop developed photolithography, making possible the mass production of tiny transistors - with the help of China-born Morris Chang, Andy Grove etc. at TI.  Shockley and, Kilby were awarded Nobel prizes, Noyce would have also won if he'd lived.  Then Intel was founded - mostly by Shockley associates who tired of his abrasiveness, founded Fairchild, and then left to avoid a meddling owner who also refused to grant them stock options. Charlie Sporck, an efficiency expert was one of the group moving to Intel - after initiating the transfer of manufacturing and assembling to a much cheaper and harder-working non-union Asia (wages one-tenth of those in America). Intel's first microprocessor held 2,300 transistors with a line width of 10,000 nanometers. The author also covers the scene when Intel leaders decided to exit the computer memory business after it became dominated by the Japanese with lower costs and higher quality (U.S. failure rates were 4.5X that of the Japanese) - the first of several industry changes following Clayton Christenson's insights about how new competitors could take over an established line of business.  Another key reporting focused on how the Russians originally focused on simply copying existing U.S. chip designs - without learning key manufacturing secrets --> minimal progress hampering them today. (Same with China - at first. China was also greatly hampered by its Cultural Revolution creating a dangerous environment for knowledge workers like Morris Chang - born in China who fled the chaos and developed excellent semiconductor skills at TI, then accepted a key position in Taiwan founding world-leading foundry TSMC. (The world would be far different now if instead China had recognized his value and lured his expertise/skills to work in China.)  Another interesting story - how the accuracy of bombs used in Vietnam was greatly improved by adding fins, sensors and a few semiconductors. Also the moving from manual chip designs to the computer-created design of new chips.  Eventually we get to China's current chip challenges - developing lithography machines (almost 500,000 parts, many with extreme precision), developing computer-assisted chip designs, and developing AI chips capable of massively parallel processing. The author contends doing so will take China many years - he may be correct, but on the other hand China is reportedly already making good progress in at least circumventing the need for advanced photolithography machines."
B09RX5F238146,B09RX5F238,Chris Miller,Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,bm,2022,5.0,18,"I enjoy this book because it points out 2 key issues in the chip industry. First, can government help? The author does not say a simple yes or no. Instead he gives lots of examples worldwide (e.g. USA, Soviet Union, Taiwan, and South Korea) and let readers judge. This question is crucial for China's chip industry as the Chinese government spends billions of dollars to promote it. I think the part about China is the most interesting part of this book.  Second, the author points out that chips matter more than data. Data is NOT the new oil. We produce tons of data every second. But without chip, such data are useless. And the making of cutting-edge chips is in the hands of just a few firms, even more concentrated that the oil cartel.  So, a key question is how these ""choke points"" affect the chip industry and the world at large.  I also appreciate the author's skill to explain technology (e.g., the working of lithography, the principle of EUV) in terms that tech outsiders like me can easily understand. As the author says, chip is not just about technology, but also about political-economy and society  Finally I like this book as each chapter is quite short. It's easy for me to finish one chapter while I am taking metro from my home to my office."
B09RX5F238147,B09RX5F238,Chris Miller,Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,bm,2022,5.0,10,"Tufts professor Chris Miller makes a strong case that computer chips have become to the 2first century what oil was to the 20th century in terms of global politics. Computer chips are now ubiquitous and have uncountable applications in industry, consumer products and military hardware. We found that out when pandemic related supply shortages shut down production in a host of industries.  Miller plows over old ground with his discussion of the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 to the co-invention of the integrated circuit in 1956 by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Bob Noyce who would go on to lead Intel. He then goes on to discuss the “traitorous eight” who bail out of Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968 to for what was to become the Intel behemoth. They all wanted to get rich.  The government plays a major role in supporting the industry. The need to reduce the weight of the Minuteman missile sent the Pentagon scurrying to buy integrated circuits from Texas Instruments. As the Cold War heats up more and more integrated circuits find their way into military hardware. I remember in 1967 when I was working for Litton Industries, I first noticed integrated circuits appearing in airborne guidance and control systems.  Not mentioned in the book, Texas Instruments benefited from the Kennedy/Johnson White Houses sending defense contracts to Texas and New England. Silicon Valley in California was left out in the cold, but more than compensated by going after the lucrative civilian market.  To me most interesting was the role of Texas Instruments engineer Morris Chang who invented chip production processes. When he was passed over to be president of the company he moves to Taiwan and is instrumental in establishing Taiwan Semiconductor, now the largest manufacturer of chips in the world. Who knows what would have become of Texas Instruments if he became its president.  It is Morris Chang who makes Taiwan a semiconductor powerhouse and that is the reason why most of the world’s chips are made there today. Being located 100 miles from China is not exactly the safest place in world to manufacture this critical commodity. It is for this reason there now is a move to diversify production to other sources including the huge U.S. government subsidies now being funneled into the domestic chip industry.  Because both the Russians and the Chinese understand how critical computer chips are, they established their own industries. The Russians did what they do best which was to copy the west, but with the technology advancing so quickly that became a failing strategy. China, on the other hand, is making a huge investment in their own chip industry to wean their economy’s dependence on western made chips and equipment. In case of the latter there was a story today where Chinese spies obtained secrets from ASML, the Dutch monopoly supplier of extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment. Their machines are essential in the manufacture of chips and cost $100 million apiece.  The saddest part of the book is Miller recounting the decline of Intel. It seems the bean counters took over from the engineers. In 2008 Intel turned down Steve Jobs’ offer to them to make chips for the I-Phone ceding the market to Qualcomm. Thus, Intel was nowhere in communication chips, and it is being rapidly displaced in the server market by graphics processing chips being made by NVIDIA and AMD.  Miller’s book reads like a fast-paced business thriller. There are great anecdotes and reader will learn much about what will shape geopolitics this decade and beyond."
B09RX5F238148,B09RX5F238,Chris Miller,Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,bm,2022,5.0,10,"A great book covering the history of semiconductors like silicon and highlighting their importance. Silicon in the form of CPUs, GPUs, and memory light up the tech that drives the digital economy as well as protects our national interest. Silicon is in our computers, our phones, our datacenters, our cars, our hospitals, and our military equipment. It's driving our GDP today. The US started the silicon generation in the 50s and 60s and still maintains leadership with our designs and design tools. However, we are behind in the race to manufacture the leading technologies. The majority of leading technologies are now manufactured in Taiwan and South Korea. This puts us in a precarious position with China and their intent to unify with Taiwan as well as control our own destiny when it comes to building things that are vital for the country. China is way behind in building leading edge silicon and are trying all sorts of ways to compete (including spying.) In the short term, we need to protect Taiwan and South Korea. In the long term, we need to develop the ability to manufacture are own leading edge silicon technologies. The pandemic has shown us globalism is a failure for those items too important to entrust with others. We need to control our destiny. This means the government needs to invest in things like the CHIPs Act which supports our semiconductor industries (all other governments give considerable support to their semiconductor industries), and we need more semiconductor engineers. Semiconductors will drive our economy and national security for years to come."

First - there is a company called Advanced RISC Machines, abbreviated ARM, which he erroneously refers to as Arm (no understanding that it is an acronym.  It's like calling International Business Machines  Ibm corp). .  Second, he claims that the US Government hobbled Huawei's sales to US entities solely to give US companies a competitive advantage.  He completely missed the fact that the US Government's action was taken because of fear of building our communications infrastructure based on Chinese equipment would leave the US vulnerable to spying and hacking.  The problem is I do not know what other errors are in this text that I will not be aware of, but if he missed these basic things I am not optimistic."

As such, I was already convinced in the power of the method. I did not need to be convinced, yet most of the book attempts to sell the method without much detail on how to put it into practice.

B0BGK74SR5155,B0BGK74SR5,Dan Sullivan,10x Is Easier Than 2x: How World-Class Entrepreneurs Achieve More by Doing Less,bm,2023,5.0,16,"I have heard Dan Sullivan speak to 10x being easier than 2x multiple times.  I appreciated the concept.  When I joined Strategic Coach, I went through the exercise and did more than appreciate the concept:  I started building plans around it.  10x is attainable in my company and, Dan is right, it is easier than 2x.  So, what role this book?  Why does it matter?  I have been told that when you present to an audience, you need:  ""The What If"" - a straightforward notion that can inspire those who are quick to take action and run with it.  ""The What"" - a few more specifics for those who require additional details. After receiving the ""what,"" they are off and running, but they need the ""what"" to get started.  ""The Why"" - those individuals who require an explanation before proceeding are familiar to us all.  ""The How"" - a set of instructions. Certain people require a step-by-step approach.  Before this book, I have seen some real results with simply the ""what if"" of 10x being easier than 2x.  It's pretty revolutionary and has changed many things around here.  This book is the what, the why, and the how.  And it's fantastic.  This book serves as a comprehensive guide that explains the what, the why, and the how of the 10x approach. It is a fantastic resource. I understand that it may sound like promotional rhetoric - doing more while working less just does not seem plausible. However, it is feasible with the correct understanding of the what, the why, and the how.  You must read this book."
B0BGK74SR5156,B0BGK74SR5,Dan Sullivan,10x Is Easier Than 2x: How World-Class Entrepreneurs Achieve More by Doing Less,bm,2023,5.0,5,"This book LOGICALLY laid out WHY 10x is easier than 2x.  I read a LOT of books.  1-3 a week.  Almost all non-fiction.  Most are good, some are great.  A few change my perception of how the world works, forever.  This one, and their other collaboration ""Who, Not How"" both did that.  I honestly did not believe this would live up to the last one.  I was wrong.  Worth the money and time invested.  Am on my second reading through."
B0BGK74SR5157,B0BGK74SR5,Dan Sullivan,10x Is Easier Than 2x: How World-Class Entrepreneurs Achieve More by Doing Less,bm,2023,4.0,5,"Overall, it’s a good book. If you have read 10X by Grant Cardone,  you should read this one too as it goes deeper into how to actually do 10X.  The letdown is this book is repetitive and has many filler pages. Could have been at least 50 pages lesser."
