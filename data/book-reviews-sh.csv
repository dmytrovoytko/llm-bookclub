B007A4SDCG000,B007A4SDCG,Steven Pressfield,The War of Art,sh,2011,2.0,778,"TLDR: This book is written as a motivational text. It tries to make a rousing argument, but is undercut by some ludicrous and unsupportable conjecture. It will resonate with some people and turn others off. Read on for a more detailed explanation.  The books is, roughly, divided into three sections: Resistance, Combating Resistance, and Beyond Resistance.  The first section was actually really good. It mostly got into what Resistance is - the counterforce to achievement - and the various ways it manifests itself. While not based on any sort of evidence or research, this section lays out an allegorical enemy worthy of an epic struggle.  The second section is mostly about how a professional behaves and how this behavior can overcome Resistance. The summary of this section is: show up, do the work, do not get distracted. This was the most prescriptive section of the book, but I'd say it leaned more towards inspiration than prescription. If someone complains that this book is ""just common sense"", it is probably this section they are referring to.  Emboldened by a couple solid sections, the author goes completely off the rails in the third. The book becomes very religious, espouses lousy pop psychology, and makes outlandish claims. If I were to sum this section up, I'd say the author puts forth the idea that the artist is a conduit for some sort of divine inspiration or work, made manifest through the benevolent intervention of angels. That might be slightly harsh summary, but not too far off the mark. He literally says ""We were put here on earth to act as agents of the Infinite"" and ""The artist is the servant of that intention, those angels, that Muse."" Okay, perhaps he's just being allegorical. Nope. When talking about the fruits of our labor, he says ""That is to do the work and give it to Him. Do it as an offering to God."" I am not against a religious message, but it was not what I was expecting. I felt like the author was trying to proselytize me.  Putting the religious aspects of section 3 aside, the rest of it is the worst kind of shoot-from-the-hip psychology. He does a deep dive into the Ego - ignoring the conventional definition and redefines it for his own purposes. He tries to draw a distinction between a hierarchical and territorial mode of thinking - unsuccessfully. He makes outlandish claims, like ignoring the authentic self may be the cause of cancer and embracing the self might be its cure. He, literally, says that becoming your authentic self could cure cancer. This is advice that could kill someone. He goes on to explain how the colloquialisms for inebriation - stoned, smashed, hammered - are all referring to the destruction of the Ego in order to access the Self. There's no etymological basis for his statement. There is not even any anecdotal evidence to support this. When speaking about the relationship between a mother and her child, he says ""She knows it came out of her but not from her, through her but not of her."" It's an interesting thought, but biologically incorrect. Lastly, he makes claims that are openly contrary. He says ""Union and mutual assistance are the imperatives of life"", but a few pages later says it would be incorrect to call friends for reassurance if you were feeling anxious. To me, this section felt like a mess and it ruined the book for me.  In summary, this book is a snapshot of a specific artist's mental model of the creative struggle. I makes claims and gives advice that is unsupportable, incorrect, and sometimes contradictory. If you are reading this with a critical or skeptical eye, then you are unlikely to enjoy it. I really think that for this book to speak to you, you need to accept it at face value - almost as a scripture or gospel."
B007A4SDCG001,B007A4SDCG,Steven Pressfield,The War of Art,sh,2011,5.0,44,"Published in 2002, The War of Art is about breaking through blocks that hold you back and disciplining yourself to do important work and pursue your calling. This book is aimed at creative artists, especially writers. But it contains lessons for anyone pursuing growth in any area who feels blocked by self-sabotaging behavior or failure to act.  The premise is that there are hidden forces working against us, leading to inaction, distraction, procrastination, complacency, fear and self-destructive behavior. The author calls these forces ""resistance."" They exist within us as negative tendencies or programming in our subconscious. The resistance may also be outside us, as in associations with the wrong people, or addiction to distractions (which today includes social media).  Resistance doesn’t only affect writers. It hits in endeavors such as business, education, breaking bad habits and even, wrote Pressfield, ""Any diet or health regimen.” The back cover blurb says, “Dream about writing the great American novel? Regret not finishing your paintings? Wish you could start dieting or exercising today? Hope to run a marathon some day?” Resistance is what holds us back from these undertakings.  The War of Art is divided into three parts. In part one, Defining The Enemy, Pressfield describes the insidious nature of resistance. He explains it from his perspective as a writer, but lists many activities that elicit resistance. This includes any pursuit that calls for rejecting instant gratification in favor of long-term growth, health or integrity. He also warns of the cost of giving in to resistance.  In part two, Combatting Resistance, you’re encouraged that resistance can be beaten. The way is by turning pro and ceasing to act like an amateur. You learn that this is not an easy task. You only turn pro by practicing self-discipline and pursuing self-mastery.  Here’s a partial list of what Pressfield says turning pro looks like: 1. The pro shows up every day no matter what. 2. The pro is committed for the long haul. 3. The pro knows the stakes are high and real. 4. The pro masters the technique of their craft. 5. The pro doesn’t accept excuses. 6. The pro keeps working with the cards he is dealt. 7. The pro is a student of the game for life and open to coaching. 8. The pro reinvents himself. 9. The pro endures adversity. 10. The pro is patient.  The third part of The War of Art is called, Beyond Resistance: Higher Realm. Some readers might find this part strange or even off-putting as it touches on spiritual topics. The author uses the term “muses” or even “angels” to describe the invisible source of inspiration that spurs us on to do our work. However, depending on your belief system, you could conceptualize this two ways:  One, this is the subconscious. This powerful part of our mind stores everything we’ve ever seen, read and experienced and can call it up into conscious awareness. It can also assemble old ideas and knowledge into new combinations. It is the wellspring of our creativity. Two, there’s a universal consciousness. This is a higher power, creative in nature, and possessing all knowledge. We are connected to it, or one with it in individualized form. We can call on it. But we can also cut ourselves off from this inspiration if we identify only with the ego and physical self.  The second interpretation appears more powerful, infinitely so. In either case, the author does not suggest just sitting around to pray or meditate. The key is setting an intention and then starting the work. You commit to show up and simply begin no matter what. As you begin, you ask for guidance (“invoke the muse”), and the beneficent unseen forces show up. You’re inspired to keep taking action.  You’re infused with energy. Ideas keep popping into your head.  A core message is that we are creative and growth-oriented beings by nature and we have a channel to a creative source. Failure to act on our higher urges, do our work and create something or grow as a person means a life unlived, and cheating others out of our potential contributions.  Pressfield has a unique, impactful style. There are a couple F bombs, but colorful language is not gratuitous. At 165 pages, you can zip through the book quickly, especially because some pages contain only one paragraph.  I can understand how this book might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it resonated with me. On the cover, a blurb from Esquire says, “… a kick in the ass.”  That’s exactly how I’d describe it too."
B007A4SDCG002,B007A4SDCG,Steven Pressfield,The War of Art,sh,2011,5.0,21,"I love this book.  Steven Pressfeild accurately describes the inner voice of resistance that I hear chattering away at me daily, telling me all sorts of lousy, unkind things. The voice lies to me, wants to keep me fearful, unhappy and unproductive.  He then introduces the concept of ""Turning Pro"".  The Pro still hears all that  racket but does his work or follows ""the pursuit of any calling"" regardless of what the internal noise says.  The Pro knows the voice will always be there.  The Pro keeps working no matter how loud resistance tries to speak.  Another book I love addresses resistance in a brilliant way.  [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]] is a fabulous and inspiring book by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The authors offer an amazing possibility regarding resistance: notice the resistance, without judging it, and the resistance falls away.  The mere act of noticing and allowing whatever is happening to simply be the way it is, allows the very thing to dissolve.  I have tried it and it works.  This innovative book has a unique and exciting feature: each story has an online web address that links you to a video of the very people you were just reading about.  I love that I can ""watch"" part of this book as well as read it's wisdom.  I am touched and energized by both of these smart and enlightening reads."
B007A4SDCG003,B007A4SDCG,Steven Pressfield,The War of Art,sh,2011,1.0,16,"I was done the moment the author started dismissing real mental health issues as ""made up"" and blaming medication for a lack of creativity. I assure you, things like SAD and Social Anxiety are very real."
B007A4SDCG004,B007A4SDCG,Steven Pressfield,The War of Art,sh,2011,3.0,6,"The urge for synchronicity is strong in this Jedi. Pressfield has invented his own religion by weaving together threads from various religions, philosophies and myths.  He describes the burden/freedom of creating work, or maybe even being a human, in a Zen-like, guru-esque narrative. When it's all said and done, it's a ride-along in his head.  If you liked Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Power of Now or A Course in Miracles, you will like this; if you have a faith heritage and appreciate scriptural traditions, probably not so much."
B07H453KGH005,B07H453KGH,David Goggins,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,sh,2018,5.0,632,"This book is more than just another sh book. David Goggins is the real deal; a man who came from struggle and hardship, accomplished many impressive feats and became one of the toughest men alive. In this book he lays out his life story, with all the hardships he faced and how he came out stronger for it. With this book he does not just offer short term motivation but rather a deep shift in your mindset that will help you achieve your fullest potential, as long as you are willing to put in the work. After reading this book I finally understand what was wrong with my mentality and I can safely say that I now have a new attitude towards life and achieving my goals. Now I understand what it takes to live up to your full potential, which is something that 99% of people are never quite able to do. Here's a hint- it does not happen without suffering. This book is worth its weight in gold."
B07H453KGH006,B07H453KGH,David Goggins,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,sh,2018,5.0,11,"“Goggins,” my OIC said after giving me the good news, “you are the type of (motherf*) who wishes you were a POW just to see if you have what it takes to last.”  This comment very well sums up David Goggins’ mental fortitude. Healthy/unhealthy, sane/insane; Goggins is a unique individual with phenomenal achievements filling his résumé on top of a tragic past.  Can’t Hurt Me is eye opening and inspiring. Goggins’ life had my jaw dropping and lent to some intensely fascinating reading. Fully agree with his “#takingsouls” and “#cookiejar“ mentality or not, the man’s records and accomplishments speak for themselves.  “…it’s not the external voice that will break you down. It’s what you tell yourself that matters. The most important conversations you’ll ever have are the ones you’ll have with yourself. You wake up with them, you walk around with them, you go to bed with them, and eventually you act on them. Whether they be good or bad.”"
B07H453KGH007,B07H453KGH,David Goggins,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,sh,2018,5.0,10,"Yes, David Goggins curses a lot! (IF you dismiss this book for that reason, you will have missed out on one of the most transformational books you will ever read (If not THE most transformational) = Get over it!)  YES, Goggins uses some language deemed derogatory by many, like language equated to women, but not necessarily women = HUGE missed opportunity if you dismiss this book for that reason.  While no review can aptly review the brilliance of this book — “Ca not Hurt Me,"" convincingly shows we it’s readers that EVERYTHING and ANYTHING IS possible, if we:  1. STOP looking for validation from others 2. Take 100% responsibility (No one, NOT ONE other talks about owning 100% responsibility like Goggins!) 3. Stalk difficulty — AND train your mind to:   * LOVE difficulty, it’s what makes us stronger   * REVEL in the gold difficulty offers 4. OWN that we live at 40% capacity, so we can take REAL action  Goggins doesn’t tell us ONCE what he thinks we should do — He SHOWS us, in the most compelling narrative I’ve ever read. I can’t sing the praises of “Can’t Hurt Me,” highly enough. It’s brilliant, with it’s authenticity and rawness. It’s deeply emotional, without emotion and poor-me mentality. It’s effective, in his selection of stories and ability to effectively build upon another. I’m in awe of what he’s created here. This book, “Can’t Hurt Me,” is not a spiritual text, but I say you’ll be hard pressed to not say you didn’t feel Spirit move through these pages, as you close the back cover!  PS — With the understanding that we can’t make everyone happy, NOR does he try, “Can’t Hurt Me,” currently holds a solid 5-star rating with near 1400 reviews! Seems Googins’ has hit our desire to FEEL what authenticity AND excellence FEEL like within ourselves!  My review emerges from reading one book per week."
B07H453KGH008,B07H453KGH,David Goggins,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,sh,2018,4.0,8,"I read this book in a day because I knew I needed some mental resetting. Life will hardly ever play fair and sometimes it can be incredibly awful with no apparent light at the end of the tunnel. In times where circumstances are out of our control and make us feel like disappearing, there are still things within our control that we can work on mastering… namely our mind and actions. You won’t make everyone happy and sometimes people will decide to hate you without knowing much about you, that’s life. Situations that test us will either destroy or make us stronger, we get to choose how we channel the frustration and anguish of those hard times.  This is a great book for anyone who wants to refocus their attention to things they can control rather than spending time and energy frustrated by the actions of other people or circumstances."
B07H453KGH009,B07H453KGH,David Goggins,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,sh,2018,5.0,5,"If this is not the most Motivating, Hooah, books of the year then I do not know what is.  If this book does not compel you to move your ass, then I am not sure what can.  Giving this one to my boys in the Army.  Goggins  comes straight, with that no holds barred, military pride.  Excellent book!  This is a definite must read for all, so damn inspiring. Stayed up all night reading this, that's how good this book was.  Kudos!!!"
B089DQRDSV010,B089DQRDSV,Brianna Wiest,The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,sh,2020,2.0,769,"I read this in a book club of 40-some year olds who are well on the path of seeking wellness, self-education, and self-improvement.  (We had just finished The Book of Joy by The Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.)  The first four chapters found us wanting to quit the book due to lack of substance.  We stuck it through to the end, though, because we know that every endeavor can teach us something, and we wanted to give this young writer a chance.  Chapter 5, 6, and 7 felt like a different writer, bringing much more ""meat.""  However, the author's approach is reckless in that she asks the reader to review the deepest hurts of their lives in order to contrast how many successes they can also count, YET she does not give them TOOLS to deal with the dangers of this instruction.  With so many comments focusing on love relationships, it seems the financially stable-ish 18- to 24-year-old person is the target audience.  HOWEVER, I would recommend a person who is young to read a book by an older writer who is *professionally trained in the field* in order to get more out of the experience.  The author's effort and love to help others is nice, but her skill and wisdom is lacking, making this an overall unfruitful read.  (Our next book is Braving the Wilderness by Brene Brown.)"
B089DQRDSV011,B089DQRDSV,Brianna Wiest,The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,sh,2020,5.0,110,"When I read self help type books, I will highlight if I come across something that rings true. I will use a second stronger color if it provides insight or a new path I had not seen/thought of before, or that I had forgotten.  I think I may have marked more of this book than not.  Due to the nature of books on self, it's hard to say whether I would recommend this book to you. If you are looking for someone else to provide answers, this is not the book. This is more like a quiet voice in your ear helping to give you new places to look inside for those answers.  You can find the authors work on Medium if you want a good sampling of her voice/style. It's what led me here. Hope this helps."
B089DQRDSV012,B089DQRDSV,Brianna Wiest,The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,sh,2020,5.0,87,"This book is long on platitudes, but short on practicality. However, I do not judge the author harshly for that. It is engaging, interesting, and inspirational, in its own way. Look, if the answers to these difficult questions were easy, everyone would be at the peak of their enlightenment. The author does what all other authors of these works do: they point us in the direction of enlightenment, but tell us that it's up to us how we get there. To be sure, books like this can lay a foundation by telling us what is possible, and maybe that's all this needs to be. In any case, you will not find easy answers here. The irony is that you are not meant to."
B089DQRDSV013,B089DQRDSV,Brianna Wiest,The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,sh,2020,2.0,66,"This book is basically one inspirational quote after another with very little how to or practical steps to do the work the author recommends. It is all very superficial, yet dense, as she packed as much as she possible could into each chapter. The structure of the text is weak, as she ties together one thing after another in what seems to be a stream of thought. She provides minimal sources, and not very good ones at that.  It seems like the author has spent years reading self help books and basically tries to tie it all together in a single place.  In the process she grossly oversimplifies everything. I struggled to get through this book, honestly."
B089DQRDSV014,B089DQRDSV,Brianna Wiest,The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery,sh,2020,5.0,41,"I am so glad I got this book versus the other book I was eyeing. The other one was more expensive, naturally I assumed it was somehow better, Ha! I was wrong. This book will ground you when you have been spinning your broken wheel for most of your life and now you are ready for a change. ""When the student is ready the teacher will appear."" - Tao Te Ching I certainly found this book when I needed it. I will always cherish the insights given to me by other books - the plain fact is that sometimes just ""doing it"" is the cure to most procrastination. But when you find outward actions as monotonous or pointless, it's the time to deep dive. This book will be your guide to your buried treasure within."

The information is always a personal view and conclusions from the author rather than a researched and backed analysis of the subject being presented. Every piece of advice or information can be derived from common sense with very little insight or novelty for someone with a slightly over average skill for overcoming negative situations. I can’t imagine what kind of individual would benefit from this book other than the author himself. I don’t recommend this nor other books by this author."
