Project can be tested and deployed in **GitHub CodeSpaces** (the easiest option, and free), cloud virtual machine (AWS, Azure, GCP), or just locally with/without GPU! Works with Ollama and ChatGPT.

For GitHub CodeSpace option you don't need to use anything extra at all - just your favorite web browser + GitHub account is totally enough.
